## About

DotCraft is a .NET 10 / C# Agent Harness. It organizes AI workflows around a real project folder, allowing multiple entry points to share one session core, configuration, skills, tools, tasks, and observability surface.

- Project first: plugins, skills, sessions, and memory are integrated with the project, the agent can better understand your project.
- Unified session model: CLI, Desktop, TUI, chatbots, etc, all applications reuse the same execution engine.
- Observability and governance: approvals, traces, Dashboard, Hooks, and sandbox settings make agent workflows easier to inspect and control.
- Extensibility and integration: AppServer, SDKs, and plugins support custom entry points and business workflows.

## Get Started

For first-time use, start from Desktop:

1. Download the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DotHarness/dotcraft/releases).
2. Choose a real project folder as your workspace.
3. Configure an OpenAI-compatible API key or CLIProxyAPI.
4. Create a session and send your first repository-understanding request.

See [Getting Started](https://dotharness.github.io/dotcraft/en/getting-started) for the full guided flow with screenshots.
