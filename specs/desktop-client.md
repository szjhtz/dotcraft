## 1. Scope

### 1.1 What This Spec Defines

- The user-visible behavior of the Desktop client while connected to DotCraft AppServer.
- How users open workspaces, connect, browse threads, send turns, review results, and respond to approvals.
- How protocol events change user-visible state.
- How secondary surfaces such as Skills and Automations behave from the user's perspective.
- How users discover, configure, enable, and recover Desktop-managed channel modules.
- How the client communicates failure, recovery, and availability constraints.
- Localization, accessibility, and performance expectations at the UX level.

### 1.2 What This Spec Does Not Define

- Wire protocol payloads, transport rules, or server semantics already defined in [appserver-protocol.md](appserver-protocol.md).
- TypeScript module contract details (manifest schema, package exports, launcher contract, and conformance rules) defined in [plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md).
- Frontend frameworks, component trees, IPC method signatures, process architecture, or state-store structure.
- Layout geometry, colors, typography, icons, spacing, animation, or other visual design details.
- Platform-specific implementation APIs for notifications, menus, file search, or file persistence.

---

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

1. Expose the AppServer protocol as a desktop workflow optimized for persistent threads and long-running agent work.
2. Support multi-thread productivity, including switching between threads while background work continues.
3. Preserve a clear review loop for approvals, file changes, plans, tool output, and automation runs.
4. Make connection state and recovery paths understandable without requiring users to understand protocol internals.
5. Keep workspace behavior predictable across reconnects, restarts, and concurrent clients.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Embedding the DotCraft runtime in-process.
- Acting as a full IDE, terminal emulator, or general-purpose file browser.
- Freezing a specific visual layout or frontend architecture.
- Defining remote plugin UI, mobile UX, or future task-board behavior in detail.

---

## 3. Connection and Session Lifecycle

### 3.1 Workspace Entry

- The Desktop client is workspace-centric. A user opens one workspace at a time in one window.
- Opening a workspace starts a connection attempt to an AppServer instance for that workspace.
- The client may support multiple connection modes, but the UX contract is the same: the user selects or opens a workspace, the client connects, and thread operations remain unavailable until initialization succeeds.

### 3.2 Connection States

The client exposes four user-visible connection states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `connecting` | The client is attempting to establish transport and complete protocol initialization. |
| `connected` | Initialization is complete and thread operations are available. |
| `disconnected` | A previously working connection is currently unavailable, but recovery may still be possible. |
| `error` | Connection failed or cannot proceed without user intervention. |

### 3.3 Initial Load

- After connection becomes `connected`, the client loads the minimum data needed for conversation workflows:
  - server capabilities (including whether `configChange` notifications are enabled for this connection)
  - thread list for the active workspace identity
  - optional capability-gated surfaces such as skills, automations, or model catalog
- If no thread exists, the client presents an empty ready state that clearly allows starting a new conversation.

### 3.4 Reconnection

- On unexpected disconnect, the client transitions to `disconnected` and attempts reconnection automatically.
- During reconnect, the user must be able to tell that prior thread data is still local UI state while live updates are temporarily unavailable.
- After reconnect, the client completes a fresh protocol handshake and restores the active session context:
  - reload active capabilities
  - re-establish the active thread subscription when applicable
  - refresh thread and automation data that may have changed while offline
- If recovery succeeds, the state returns to `connected` without requiring the user to rebuild local context manually.
- If recovery fails persistently, the state becomes `error` and the user is given a retry path.

### 3.5 Workspace Switching

- Switching workspace is treated as leaving one session context and entering another.
- The previous workspace window state may be remembered, but protocol state must not leak across workspaces.
- A switch resets the active thread selection unless the new workspace has a valid equivalent remembered locally.

### 3.6 Multiple Windows

- Each window is scoped to one workspace.
- Multiple windows may be open concurrently for different workspaces.
- User actions in one window must not implicitly change thread selection or visible state in another window.

---

## 4. Protocol Event to UX Behavior

This section defines how protocol messages affect user-visible behavior. It intentionally describes UX outcomes rather than internal state implementation.

### 4.1 Thread Events

| Protocol event | UX behavior |
|---------------|-------------|
| `thread/started` | The new thread appears in the thread navigation area and may become selectable immediately. |
| `thread/renamed` | Any visible thread label updates everywhere the thread is referenced. |
| `thread/deleted` | The thread is removed from navigation and from any active context. If currently open, the user is moved to a safe fallback state. |
| `thread/statusChanged` | Thread availability updates immediately. Actions that are no longer valid must be disabled or blocked. |
| `thread/resumed` | The thread returns to an active, turn-capable state. |

### 4.2 Turn Events

| Protocol event | UX behavior |
|---------------|-------------|
| `turn/started` | The active thread enters a running state. Sending a new turn on the same thread is blocked. |
| `turn/completed` | Running indicators clear and final turn results are shown. |
| `turn/failed` | The user sees that the turn ended unsuccessfully and is given a path to retry or continue. |
| `turn/cancelled` | The running state clears and the user sees that the turn was interrupted. |

### 4.3 Item Events

| Protocol event | UX behavior |
|---------------|-------------|
| `item/started` | New agent work becomes visible in the current thread. |
| `item/agentMessage/delta` | Agent text streams incrementally when streaming is enabled. |
| `item/reasoning/delta` | Reasoning content is exposed only if the client chooses to show reasoning. |
| `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` | Tool argument construction streams incrementally. For known built-in tools, the client renders a bespoke running label (e.g. "Writing <path>", "Searching \"<pattern>\"", "Drafting plan...") and, where useful, a progressive preview of the parsed argument fields. For unknown tools (including MCP and module tools), the client renders a generic "Generating parameters for <toolName>..." placeholder without surfacing the raw argument JSON. |
| `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` | Running shell output is appended live to the matching command block in both the conversation view and the Terminal review surface. |
| `item/completed` | The final item output replaces or finalizes any in-progress representation. |
| `item/usage/delta` | Context usage indicators refresh when the client surfaces real-time usage. |

### 4.4 Approval Events

| Protocol event | UX behavior |
|---------------|-------------|
| `item/approval/request` | The current thread enters a waiting-for-user-decision state. The approval request becomes the highest-priority interaction. |
| `item/approval/resolved` | The approval decision is reflected immediately and the thread resumes or terminates according to the decision. |

### 4.5 Supplemental Events

| Protocol event | UX behavior |
|---------------|-------------|
| `subagent/progress` | The client may surface background worker progress if useful, but must not block the main conversation. |
| `plan/updated` | Structured task progress becomes available in the current conversation context. |
| `system/event` | Maintenance steps may be surfaced when relevant but must not overshadow core turn output. |
| `system/jobResult` | Automation or heartbeat output becomes visible as an out-of-band result associated with its source run. |
| `cron/stateChanged` | Automation status views refresh to reflect the current job state. |
| `thread/goal/updated` | Goal-aware surfaces for the affected thread update from the server snapshot without forcing thread navigation. |
| `thread/goal/cleared` | Goal-aware surfaces for the affected thread remove the current goal snapshot without forcing thread navigation. |
| `workspace/configChanged` | Settings-adjacent surfaces re-fetch impacted regions (`skills`, `mcp`, `externalChannel`, workspace config fields, including welcome-suggestion personalization state) without requiring manual full-page refresh. |

### 4.6 General Rules

- If the active thread is subscribed, updates should appear without requiring manual refresh.
- If the user is viewing another thread when an inactive thread changes, the client may indicate background activity but must not forcibly switch context.
- When a capability is absent, the corresponding UX surface is disabled or hidden rather than failing late.

---

## 5. Core Interaction Flows

### 5.1 Open a Workspace

1. User opens or selects a workspace.
2. Client begins connecting and makes connection state visible.
3. After initialization succeeds, the client loads threads and any capability-gated data needed for the default workspace view.
4. If no thread is selected, the user is shown a clear starting point for a new conversation.

### 5.1.1 Welcome Suggestions

- When the workspace is connected and the conversation area is in an empty or ready-to-start state, the client may render a small set of welcome suggestions.
- Welcome suggestions are intended to feel like likely next tasks for the current workspace, not a fixed set of product-category shortcuts.
- The client may render local fallback suggestions immediately so the empty state remains useful before any server-backed result is available.
- If the server advertises `capabilities.extensions.welcomeSuggestions`, the client may call `welcome/suggestions` for the active workspace identity after connection is ready.
- Dynamic welcome-suggestion requests are gated by the current workspace personalization setting. If the workspace has personalized welcome suggestions disabled, the client must not request them and must continue showing only its local default suggestions.
- The client should replace visible fallback suggestions only when it receives a valid workspace-specific result (`source = dynamic`) from the server cache; fresh personalization updates are picked up asynchronously after successful memory consolidation, not synchronously during connection startup.
- Server-backed dynamic suggestions may come from a persisted workspace snapshot that survives Desktop shutdown and AppServer restart. This snapshot represents the latest successful dynamic result; shutdown, failed refreshes, canceled refreshes, or insufficient new evidence must not require the client to forget an already returned dynamic suggestion set.
- If the capability is absent, the request fails, the request times out, or the server responds with `source = none`, the local fallback suggestions remain visible without forcing an error state.
- Dynamic welcome suggestions must never block welcome-screen load. If no cached dynamic result exists yet for the workspace, the static fallback suggestions stay visible without a loading placeholder.
- Dynamic suggestions should use a dedicated source icon so users can distinguish personalized recommendations from the static default shortcut set.
- Suggestions should remain short, diverse, and obviously actionable when shown in a compact list.
- Choosing a suggestion prefills the input composer with the suggestion's prompt text. It must not auto-send the message or implicitly create a thread before the user confirms submission.
- The welcome suggestion surface is advisory. It should not be treated as a durable history, a command palette, or a substitute for browsing existing threads.

### 5.2 Start a New Conversation

1. User chooses to create a thread.
2. Client calls `thread/start`.
3. The new thread becomes active immediately after success.
4. The input area becomes ready for the first message.
5. If thread creation fails, the user remains in the prior safe state with a retry path.

### 5.3 Resume or Open an Existing Thread

1. User selects a thread from the navigation area.
2. Client loads the thread content with enough history to make the conversation understandable.
3. Client subscribes to future updates for the selected thread when real-time updates are needed.
4. If the thread is not turn-capable, the user sees why and which actions remain allowed.

### 5.4 Send a Message

1. User composes input and submits it.
2. If the thread is idle and turn-capable, the client calls `turn/start`.
3. The thread enters a running state and duplicate submissions for the same thread are blocked.
4. Incremental output appears as events arrive.
5. When the turn finishes, the thread returns to an idle, completed, failed, or cancelled state.

### 5.5 Input Rules

- The input area accepts plain text and any supported structured attachments or references.
- The client must prevent submission of an empty turn.
- If the thread is currently running, the client must either block a second submission on that thread or convert it into an explicit queued-follow-up behavior. The behavior must be consistent and visible to the user.
- If attachments cannot be preserved in a queued or deferred path, the user must be warned before the message is sent.

### 5.6 Approval Handling

1. An approval request arrives while a turn is running.
2. The active thread enters a waiting-approval state.
3. The approval request is surfaced with enough information for the user to decide.
4. The user can approve, decline, session-approve when supported, or cancel as allowed by the protocol surface.
5. After the decision:
   - approved work continues
   - declined work reflects rejection and may continue with an alternative path
   - cancelled work terminates the turn
6. If approval times out or is no longer valid, the user sees the resulting turn outcome.

### 5.7 View Changes, Plans, and Tool Output

- File changes produced during a thread remain discoverable until reverted or superseded.
- Plan updates remain associated with the active thread and reflect the latest complete plan snapshot. While a `CreatePlan` tool call is still streaming its arguments, the dedicated plan surface renders a live draft (title, overview, and any fully-formed todo entries) so the user sees the plan taking shape in real time; the draft is replaced by the finalized snapshot once `plan/updated` is received.
- Tool output remains readable in-thread and must remain distinguishable from agent conversational text.
- `commandExecution` items are the Desktop client's primary source of shell output data, but the conversation view keeps the existing tool-card presentation for shell work instead of rendering command output as a standalone message block.
- In the conversation view, shell work remains collapsed by default using the normal tool-card style. If the user expands the card, live output may be shown there while the command is still running.
- The Terminal detail surface shows all `commandExecution` items for the current thread history, including in-progress commands.
- If the user switches to another thread while a command is still running, the output continues updating in the background thread state without forcing a focus change.
- Desktop does not require interactive terminal input; shell output is read-only from the Desktop client's perspective.
- The client may reveal related context automatically when new changes or plans appear, but the rule should be based on relevance, not on any fixed panel design.

### 5.8 Interrupt a Running Turn

1. User requests interruption while a turn is running.
2. Client calls `turn/interrupt`.
3. The running state remains visible until interruption is confirmed by protocol outcome.
4. When `turn/cancelled` arrives, the client returns the thread to a safe idle state.

### 5.9 Archive and Delete

- Archived threads remain readable but not turn-capable.
- The client may expose a dedicated archived-thread management surface for browsing and restore actions.
- Restoring an archived thread returns it to the active thread set without forcing automatic navigation into that conversation.
- Deleted threads disappear from the client once deletion is confirmed.
- If a thread is archived or deleted elsewhere while open locally, the user must see the updated state immediately and lose only the actions that are no longer valid.

### 5.10 Cross-Channel Visibility

- If the server supports cross-channel thread discovery, the Desktop client may present threads whose origin differs from the desktop client itself.
- The UX contract is that origin differences must not make the thread list confusing:
  - origin may be shown when useful
  - unsupported actions must be disabled rather than failing unexpectedly
  - read and resume behavior must follow server capabilities and thread status

### 5.11 Manage Thread Goal

Desktop goal behavior is defined by [Goal Design §11.7](goal-design.md#117-desktop-ux-contract).

At the Desktop UX level:

- Goals are exposed as a conversation control, not as an AppServer custom command.
- When `capabilities.threadGoals = true`, the slash reference surface includes a system Goal action above Commands and Skills. This capability means the server owns the complete goal runtime; Desktop only controls and displays it.
- Active goal state is summarized in the composer footer when a current thread has a goal.
- Direct `/goal` submissions are handled locally by Desktop and translated to `thread/goal/*` requests.
- Creating a goal from the welcome screen may create a thread and set the goal without starting an agent turn.
- Goal replacement requires explicit confirmation when it would replace a different non-complete objective.
- Desktop does not start automatic goal continuation turns. When an active goal continues, Desktop observes normal `turn/*` and `item/*` notifications from the server and updates goal UI from `thread/goal/updated` / `thread/goal/cleared`.
- Goal continuation user messages with `triggerKind = "goal"` must render a visible source marker, such as "Goal auto-continue" / "目标自动推进", so users can distinguish server-initiated goal work from typed input.

### 5.12 Composer System Actions

The slash reference surface includes Desktop-owned system actions above custom Commands and Skills:

- Plan mode is always shown with the label "Plan mode". Its hint reflects the current mode: "Enable Plan mode" in Agent mode and "Disable Plan mode" in Plan mode. Selecting it uses the same local mode toggle path as `Shift+Tab` and calls `thread/mode/set`.
- Manual compaction is shown as "Compact" with the hint "Compact this session's context" only when `capabilities.manualCompaction = true`, the active thread has at least one turn, and no turn is running or waiting for approval. Selecting it calls `thread/compact/start` with the active `threadId` and a long maintenance timeout of 300 seconds.
- Manual memory consolidation is shown as "Consolidate" / "整理" with the hint "Consolidate long-term memory" only when `capabilities.manualMemoryConsolidation = true`, the active thread has at least one turn, and no turn is running or waiting for approval. Selecting it calls `thread/memory/consolidate/start` with the active `threadId` and a long maintenance timeout of 300 seconds.
- If manual compaction returns `outcome = "skipped"` or `outcome = "failed"`, Desktop shows the returned message using the same compact status surface. Short histories should normally compact through the server's full-history fallback.
- If manual memory consolidation returns `outcome = "skipped"` or `outcome = "failed"`, Desktop shows the returned message using the same transient status surface.
- Selecting a system action from slash search clears the slash query from the composer instead of leaving `/` behind.
- Direct `/plan`, `/agent`, `/compact`, and `/consolidate` submissions are handled locally and must not start a normal agent turn. `/compact` and `/consolidate` show an unavailable message instead of submitting a turn when their visibility conditions are not met. On the welcome screen, Plan mode is also shown as a system action, and `/plan` / `/agent` update the pending welcome mode without starting a thread.
- Desktop updates the context ring from the RPC response when it includes `contextUsage`, and also consumes the standard `system/event` notifications emitted during compaction.

## 6. Secondary Flows

### 6.1 Plugins and Skills

The sidebar Plugins entry opens a two-level surface with `Plugins` and `Skills` tabs. Plugins is the default tab when `capabilities.pluginManagement` is available; Skills remains available as the second tab when `capabilities.skillsManagement` is available.

Required behavior:

- Users can browse discovered and installable plugins, inspect plugin details, see included tools and skills, install or remove managed built-in plugins, and enable or disable installed plugins.
- Plugin installation, removal, and enablement refresh both plugin and skill state because plugin-contained skills are controlled by the plugin lifecycle.
- Browser Use is the built-in reference plugin. It shows the `NodeReplJs` tool and the `browser-use` skill in its included content.
- Users can enter a Skills view if the server exposes skills capabilities.
- Users can browse installed skills.
- Users can inspect the content of a selected skill.
- Users can enable or disable a skill when the server supports that action.
- Users can uninstall user-managed `workspace` and `user` skills from the skill detail dialog. Uninstalling a skill also removes its workspace-local variants.
- Skills with source `plugin` show plugin attribution.
- Skills with source `plugin` are managed through the owning plugin lifecycle and do not expose a standalone skill uninstall action.
- If a skill is unavailable because server-side requirements are unmet, the client explains that the skill exists but is currently unusable.
- If plugin or skills capability is absent, the corresponding tab or action is hidden or disabled with a clear reason.

### 6.2 Automations

The Automations surface remains within Desktop scope as a workflow, not a UI design.

Required behavior:

- Users can enter an Automations view if at least one relevant automation capability is available.
- The client separates capability availability from current data availability:
  - unsupported features are disabled
  - supported but empty features show empty states
- Automation data refreshes on entry and after server-side state changes.

### 6.3 Cron Jobs

Required behavior:

- Users can list cron jobs when `cronManagement` is available.
- Users can inspect each job's enabled state, recent result summary, and most recent associated thread when available.
- Users can enable, disable, or remove jobs when supported by the server.
- If job state changes elsewhere, the list refreshes through `cron/stateChanged` or explicit reload.
- If a job has a recent execution thread, users can open that thread's history for review.

### 6.4 Cron Run Review

- Reviewing a cron run is a read-only workflow.
- The review experience must expose the conversation and outputs associated with the most recent run thread.
- Users must be able to leave the review state without losing their place in the automations list.

### 6.5 Model Selection

- If model catalog capability is available, the client may offer model selection using server-provided values.
- If model catalog capability is absent or temporarily fails, the conversation workflow remains usable.
- Updating workspace default model and updating active-thread model must remain distinct actions when both are supported.
- The welcome-screen model picker updates the workspace default model for threads created after that change. Existing threads must continue using their captured thread model unless the user explicitly changes the model from that thread's conversation view.

### 6.6 Archived Threads

Required behavior:

- Users can enter an archived-thread management surface from Settings when thread-management capability is available.
- The archived-thread list follows the same workspace identity and cross-channel visibility rules as the main thread list, but queries with archived inclusion enabled.
- The archived-thread surface is read-only apart from restore actions; it does not provide message sending.
- Restoring a thread removes it from the archived list immediately and makes it eligible to reappear in the main thread list after local refresh or status synchronization.
- If a thread is restored or deleted elsewhere while the archived-thread surface is open, the visible list reconciles automatically without requiring a full app restart.

### 6.7 Settings Surface

The Settings surface remains within Desktop scope as a workflow contract rather than a visual-design specification.

Required behavior:

- Desktop follows the three-tier configuration model defined in [settings-reload-ux-m3.md](settings-reload-ux-m3.md): live-apply fields, subsystem-restart fields, and process-restart fields.
- `ApiKey` and `EndPoint` are proxy-aware fields. When the managed proxy is active, the fields are locked to proxy-managed values and are not directly editable.
- The legacy shared footer Save/Cancel pattern is retired. Settings actions are group-scoped (for example Apply, Restart, or Apply & Restart) based on the tier semantics of that group.
- Desktop exposes a workspace-level `Personalization` tab with an `Enable personalized welcome suggestions` toggle backed by workspace config rather than client-global preferences.
- Toggling personalized welcome suggestions applies immediately for the active workspace. On success, the client reacts to the resulting `workspace/configChanged` notification and updates the welcome surface without requiring manual refresh or app restart.
- Edit-race policy is deterministic:
  - Tier A (live-apply) preserves local in-flight edits when the client receives an echo notification for the same logical change.
  - Tier C (process-restart staged edits) discards stale staged values with a user-visible notice when proxy activation invalidates those staged values.

### 6.8 Channel Modules

This section defines the user-visible workflow for Desktop-managed TypeScript channel modules. It intentionally omits build scripts, package-pipeline internals, IPC method names, and UI component-level design.

#### 6.8.1 Discovery and Identity

- The Desktop client may expose a Modules group in the Channels workflow for discoverable channel modules.
- Module discovery is based on static module metadata and must not require Desktop to execute module business logic just to list available modules.
- Desktop may load modules from bundled and user-installed locations; if both provide the same `moduleId`, user-installed content overrides bundled content.
- Module identity is canonicalized by `moduleId` rather than folder name.
- Invalid or incomplete module metadata must not break the full modules list; invalid entries are skipped while valid modules remain available.
- Desktop may render Channels browse and detail surfaces from optional module `interface` metadata:
  - list subtitles prefer `interface.shortDescription` and fall back to package/source identity when absent.
  - detail pages prefer `interface.longDescription` for body copy and `interface.previewPrompt` for the preview phrase.
  - package name, source, variant, transport, and capability summary are treated as technical information and belong in the detail information area rather than the browse subtitle.
- Desktop must localize module `interface` metadata with the same locale fallback rules used for module display names.

#### 6.8.2 Configuration Workflow

- Module configuration is workspace-scoped and stored in `.craft/<configFileName>`.
- Desktop must allow users to view and update module configuration values required for runtime startup.
- Configuration key semantics and descriptor contracts remain defined by [plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md).
- Fields intended for interactive setup only are not treated as ordinary manual-entry fields in the default config workflow.

#### 6.8.3 Enable, Disable, and Runtime Expectations

- Users can explicitly enable and disable a module from Desktop.
- Enabling starts the module runtime workflow for the active workspace context.
- Disabling stops the module runtime workflow and returns the module to a non-running state.
- Saving configuration while a module is running must produce a clear message when restart or re-enable is required before changes take effect.
- On app quit or workspace switch, Desktop must not leave module runtimes in an undefined state; active module runtimes are stopped as part of lifecycle teardown.

#### 6.8.4 Module Status Semantics

- Module status is communicated through user-meaningful states, including at least not configured, connecting, connected, stopped, and error conditions.
- Desktop may derive module status from both local runtime lifecycle and server-observed channel availability, but the user-facing status must remain coherent and actionable.
- Module status is distinct from Desktop AppServer connection state. A connected AppServer session does not imply all enabled modules are connected.

#### 6.8.5 Interactive Setup and QR-like Flows

- If a module declares that interactive setup may be required, Desktop must provide a corresponding guided workflow.
- Desktop may consume module-produced temporary setup artifacts from `.craft/tmp/<moduleId>/...` as read-only inputs for user guidance.
- Interactive setup experiences must handle artifact refresh, expiration, and repeated setup attempts without requiring full app restart.
- If a previously ready module later re-enters an interactive-setup-required condition, Desktop must surface that requirement again and provide a recovery path.

#### 6.8.6 Variants

- Multiple module variants may exist for the same logical `channelName`.
- Desktop allows selecting which variant is active for a given channel family.
- At any given time, only one variant is active per logical channel.
- Switching variants updates the active module context and associated configuration workflow; if the previous variant is running, Desktop stops it before or during the switch.

#### 6.8.7 Refresh and Startup Restore

- Desktop supports an explicit refresh path that re-evaluates available modules without requiring full application restart.
- If Desktop supports restoring previously enabled modules on a later launch, that behavior must be best-effort:
  - missing modules are skipped safely
  - modules without valid workspace configuration are skipped safely
- Missing restore prerequisites must not block the rest of Desktop startup.

#### 6.8.8 Diagnostics and Preconditions

- Desktop must expose clear prerequisite failures for module execution (for example, missing runtime dependencies).
- Before enabling a module, Desktop validates required configuration fields and surfaces actionable guidance when data is incomplete.
- When module runtime startup or operation fails, users must receive an understandable failure signal and a next-step action (retry, reconfigure, or inspect logs).
- Diagnostics should help users distinguish setup failures, connectivity failures, and runtime crashes.

## 7. Keyboard Accessibility and Localization

### 7.1 Keyboard Expectations

- High-frequency actions must be keyboard-accessible:
  - create thread
  - send message
  - interrupt turn
  - navigate threads
  - respond to approvals
  - dismiss transient blocking overlays when safe
- If a shortcut is unavailable on one platform, an equivalent keyboard path must still exist.

### 7.2 Accessibility

- All critical workflows must be usable without relying on color alone.
- Focus order must remain predictable during thread navigation, sending, approvals, and review flows.
- Approval requests and blocking errors must move focus in a way that makes the next required action clear.
- Streaming content must remain readable as it updates.
- Hidden or disabled features must communicate why they are unavailable.

### 7.3 Localization

- All client-owned user-facing strings must be localizable.
- Server-provided identifiers, model ids, thread ids, and similar protocol values must remain stable and must not be translated as routing keys.
- Changing display language must update client-owned UX within a short and predictable refresh path.
- Locale-sensitive formatting such as time and date should follow the selected language or locale policy consistently.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery

### 8.1 Connection Errors

- If connection fails before initialization, the user sees a startup failure state with retry.
- If connection drops after initialization, the user sees a disconnected state and automatic recovery begins.
- The client must not silently discard active context during reconnection.

### 8.2 Thread Errors

- If a thread cannot be read, resumed, or updated, the user sees a clear failure message and remains in a safe prior context.
- If a selected thread disappears remotely, the client removes it and falls back to a safe empty or next-valid thread state.
- If another client starts a turn first, the user sees that the thread is busy rather than experiencing a silent send failure.

### 8.3 Turn Errors

- Failed turns remain visible in-thread with enough information to understand that work stopped.
- Users must be able to continue the conversation after a failure unless the thread itself is no longer valid.
- Interrupted turns and failed turns must be distinguishable in user-visible language.

### 8.4 Approval Errors

- If approval is no longer valid, times out, or cannot be delivered, the user sees the resulting turn outcome.
- If the client does not support approval handling for a given environment, that limitation must be known before a turn reaches a blocked state whenever possible.

### 8.5 Input and Attachment Errors

- Invalid input, unsupported attachments, oversized attachments, or failed attachment preparation must be surfaced before or at submission time.
- If a degraded fallback is used, the client must say exactly what was dropped or changed.
- Search or attachment helper failures must not corrupt the rest of the composer workflow.

### 8.6 Automation Errors

- If cron list loading fails, the Automations view remains usable enough to retry.
- If a cron action fails due to stale state, the client refreshes server truth and reconciles the visible state.
- If automation review data is missing, the user sees that the run exists but cannot currently be inspected.

## 9. Non-Functional UX Requirements

### 9.1 Responsiveness

- Streaming text should appear quickly enough to feel live rather than batch-delivered.
- User actions such as thread selection, approval response, and interrupt should visibly acknowledge input immediately, even if final protocol completion arrives later.

### 9.2 Reliability

- The client must tolerate reconnects, out-of-order user navigation, and concurrent updates from other clients without corrupting visible thread state.
- Protocol capability changes across reconnects must be reflected by enabling or disabling affected UX surfaces.

### 9.3 Platform Coverage

- The UX contract applies across supported desktop platforms.
- Platform differences may change implementation details, but not the meaning of connection state, thread state, approval flow, or automation flow.

### 9.4 Accessibility and Readability

- Long-running sessions must remain understandable over time.
- Thread history, tool output, plan progress, and automation output must remain legible in the presence of long content and repeated updates.

## 10. Phase 2 Reserved Surface

- The Desktop client may later expose task-oriented surfaces beyond conversation, skills, and automations.
- This document reserves that expansion without defining future layout or visual form.
- Any future task-board or GitHub-tracker UX must preserve the same principles used here:
  - protocol-driven behavior
  - explicit status and recovery
  - clear separation between workflow rules and visual implementation

### 10.1 Viewer Panel (Reserved)

- Desktop reserves an auxiliary right-side **viewer panel** surface that coexists with the existing changes / plan / terminal tabs and lets users open native file viewers and embedded browser tabs without leaving the workspace.
- The viewer panel must preserve the same principles this document applies to the rest of desktop behavior: protocol-driven where applicable, explicit status and recovery, and clear separation between workflow rules and visual implementation.

### 10.2 Browser Use Automation

- When Desktop declares the browser-use capability, embedded browser tabs may be controlled by the active agent through the thread-bound browser-use runtime.
- Desktop must keep the legacy `browserUse.backend` field for compatibility and may also declare `browserUse.backends` when it supports more than one browser automation backend. `desktop-iab` identifies the embedded browser backend; `chrome-extension` identifies the user's Chrome backend.
- Agent-controlled browser tabs remain regular viewer tabs: opening a browser-use tab may focus it on first open, but subsequent automation updates must not steal focus from the user's current thread or active tab.
- While an agent is actively operating a browser tab, Desktop must surface an automation state on the tab chrome, including the session name when available and a concise last-action hint when useful.
- Coordinate and locator-driven browser actions should render a virtual cursor inside the page whenever the page can accept the injected overlay. Failure to render the overlay must not block the underlying browser action.
- Navigation, screenshots, DOM snapshots, console-log inspection, and coordinate input remain subject to Desktop's browser-use policy, including local-url defaults and external-domain approval or blocking.
