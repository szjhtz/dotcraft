Purpose: define the durable architecture for DotCraft plugins, including plugin-contained skills, local plugin manifests, plugin-bundled MCP servers, client-facing plugin metadata, and the TypeScript external channel module contract.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

DotCraft plugins are host-integrated capability bundles. They distribute skills, MCP server declarations, and optional client-facing metadata without requiring the agent pipeline to know each integration's implementation details.

The plugin contribution model is:

1. **Skills**: plugin-contained DotCraft/Codex-compatible `SKILL.md` directories.
2. **MCP Servers**: plugin-contained MCP server declarations loaded into DotCraft's MCP runtime.
3. **Interface Metadata**: optional client-facing presentation metadata.

Plugin manifests do not declare model-callable native tools. Legacy manifest fields `tools`, `functions`, and `processes` are unsupported and ignored with diagnostics. External reusable services should use MCP. Thread-scoped client callback tools should use Runtime Dynamic Tools (`thread/start.dynamicTools` and `item/tool/call`) defined in [AppServer Protocol](appserver-protocol.md).

---

## 2. Local Plugin Manifest

Local plugins use this manifest path:

```text
<plugin-root>/.craft-plugin/plugin.json
```

The supported manifest schema version is `1`.

Manifest metadata includes:

- `schemaVersion`
- `id`
- `version`
- `displayName`
- `description`
- `capabilities`
- `interface`
- `skills`
- `mcpServers`
- `paths`

Plugins must declare at least one supported contribution: a plugin-contained `skills` path, plugin-bundled MCP servers, or interface metadata. Skill-only, MCP-only, and interface-only plugins are valid.

`mcpServers` is an optional manifest-relative path to a plugin-contained MCP configuration file. If omitted, DotCraft looks for `./.mcp.json` in the plugin root. The MCP file may use either `{ "mcpServers": { ... } }` or a direct server map. Plugin MCP config should use canonical DotCraft fields such as `arguments`, `environmentVariables`, and `headers`; for compatibility with common MCP config files, DotCraft also accepts `args`, `env`, and `httpHeaders` as read aliases. Plugin-bundled MCP servers use the same runtime as workspace `McpServers`; relative MCP `cwd` values resolve under the plugin root. At runtime, contributed server names are prefixed as `{pluginId}:{serverName}` to avoid collisions with workspace MCP servers and other plugins.

Effective MCP merge rules:

- Workspace `McpServers` are loaded first and remain editable workspace configuration.
- Enabled, installed plugin MCP servers are then added as read-only runtime entries with origin metadata (`kind=plugin`, `pluginId`, display name, and declared server name).
- If a plugin runtime name conflicts with a workspace server or a higher-priority plugin server, the plugin declaration is marked shadowed in plugin metadata and is not connected.
- `mcp/list` returns the effective runtime view. Workspace config writes (`mcp/upsert`, `mcp/remove`, and config persistence) never write plugin-origin servers into `.craft/config.json`.
- Plugin-bundled MCP startup is non-fatal. A missing command, bad endpoint, timeout, or protocol error is reported through MCP runtime status (`mcp/status/list` / `mcp/status/updated`) and diagnostics where applicable; it must not prevent plugin discovery, AppServer readiness, or Desktop connection. Agent tool materialization waits for the current effective MCP startup attempt to settle, so ready plugin MCP tools are available to new turns without making AppServer startup synchronous.

Example MCP plugin:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review-tools",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "displayName": "Review Tools",
  "description": "Adds review-oriented instructions and MCP tools.",
  "capabilities": ["skill", "mcp"],
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "mcpServers": "./.mcp.json",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Review Tools",
    "shortDescription": "Review workflows and MCP tools.",
    "developerName": "DotCraft",
    "category": "Coding",
    "capabilities": ["Skill", "MCP"],
    "defaultPrompt": "Review this change.",
    "brandColor": "#2563EB"
  }
}
```

`interface` contains optional UI metadata for Desktop and other clients: display name, short and long descriptions, developer, category, capability tags, default prompt, brand color, icon/logo paths, and public website/privacy/terms links. Path fields inside `interface` use the same manifest-relative path rules.

`skills` points to a plugin-contained skill directory, for example `"./skills/"`. Each child directory can contain a DotCraft/Codex-compatible `SKILL.md`. Skills contributed by enabled plugins are available in `skills/list` with source `plugin` and include `pluginId` / `pluginDisplayName` attribution. Disabling the plugin removes its contributed skills from agent context and hides compatibility built-in copies owned by that plugin.

DotCraft discovers plugin roots from:

1. Workspace-local root: `<workspace>/.craft/plugins`
2. Explicit roots in `Plugins.PluginRoots` order
3. User-global root: `<craft-home>/plugins`

Explicit roots may point either to one plugin root containing `.craft-plugin/plugin.json` or to a container directory containing multiple plugin roots. Missing roots are skipped with diagnostics. Local manifest plugins are enabled by default; `Plugins.DisabledPlugins` disables a plugin even when it is discovered from a default or explicit root.

When multiple roots contain the same plugin id, higher-priority roots win and lower-priority duplicates are skipped with diagnostics.

---

## 3. Manifest Path Rules

Manifest-relative paths must:

- Start with `./`.
- Not be absolute paths.
- Not contain `..`.
- Resolve to a path that stays inside the plugin root.

These rules apply to `skills`, `mcpServers`, `paths`, and interface asset paths.

---

## 4. Loading and Diagnostics

Plugin loading has three responsibilities:

1. The manifest parser reads `.craft-plugin/plugin.json`, validates supported fields, normalizes paths, and returns metadata plus diagnostics.
2. The discovery service scans roots, resolves duplicate plugin ids, applies plugin enablement config, and produces plugin records.
3. Enabled plugins contribute skill sources and plugin-bundled MCP server declarations to the workspace runtime.

Diagnostics are non-fatal and available to logs and UI surfaces. They cover invalid JSON, missing fields, missing supported plugin capabilities, invalid ids, invalid manifest-relative paths, unsupported legacy native tool fields, duplicate plugin ids, disabled plugins, invalid MCP declarations, and missing roots.

If a manifest declares `tools`, `functions`, or `processes`, DotCraft emits `UnsupportedPluginNativeTools` and ignores those fields. If no supported contribution remains, DotCraft also emits `MissingPluginCapabilities` and the plugin is not loaded.

Discovery or loading failures for one plugin must not prevent other plugins from loading.

---

## 5. Built-In and External Tool Sources

### Browser Use Built-In Plugin

DotCraft ships Browser Use as the built-in plugin `browser-use`. It contributes:

- The `browser-use` skill, loaded from the plugin's `skills` directory.
- Client-facing metadata for Desktop and plugin-management views.

When Browser Use is installed and enabled, DotCraft may expose the server-owned `NodeReplJs` runtime tool for threads bound to an AppServer client that advertises both Node REPL and Browser Use support. `NodeReplJs` is not declared in the plugin manifest.

The legacy plugin id `node-repl` is accepted only as a configuration alias for disabling Browser Use. New manifests, diagnostics, and configuration writes use `browser-use`.

### Chrome Built-In Plugin

DotCraft ships Chrome automation as the built-in plugin `chrome`. It contributes:

- The `chrome` skill, loaded from the plugin's `skills` directory.
- Client-facing metadata for Desktop and plugin-management views.
- Setup and diagnostic scripts for Chrome extension and Native Messaging host installation state.

When Chrome is installed and enabled, DotCraft may expose the server-owned `NodeReplJs` runtime tool for threads bound to an AppServer client that advertises both Node REPL and Browser Use support. The Chrome skill selects the `chrome-extension` browser backend inside the Node runtime; `NodeReplJs` is not declared in the plugin manifest.

Chrome setup detection must not inspect cookies, passwords, session stores, local storage, or browsing databases. The development extension uses a fixed manifest key for deterministic unpacked extension IDs; production distribution must replace it with the official Chrome Web Store, private, unlisted, or enterprise-managed extension ID.

### External Channel Tools

External channel tools are runtime-declared by channel adapters during AppServer `initialize`. Static plugin manifests are not required for external-channel runtime tools. Execution continues to use the `ext/channel/toolCall` server-to-client request defined by [External Channel Adapter](external-channel-adapter.md).

External channel tool invocations may still be projected as Session Core `pluginFunctionCall` items for wire compatibility. This projection is a runtime adapter detail, not a plugin manifest native-tool capability.

### Runtime Dynamic Tools

Runtime Dynamic Tools are declared by AppServer clients on `thread/start.dynamicTools` and are invoked through the `item/tool/call` server-to-client request. They are bound to the creating connection and are suitable for client-owned, thread-scoped capabilities such as an external review runner submitting a draft back to its caller.

Runtime Dynamic Tools are not plugin manifest tools.

### MCP Tools

MCP tools are configured through workspace `McpServers`, per-thread `ThreadConfiguration.McpServers`, or plugin-bundled MCP declarations. They are discovered by the MCP runtime and injected through the MCP tool path.

---

## 6. Built-In Plugin Lifecycle

Built-in plugin manifests are embedded resources exposed through a built-in catalog. Catalog entries are visible to clients before installation, but they are not active until installed into workspace `.craft/plugins/<pluginId>`.

Installed built-ins carry a `.builtin` marker:

- `plugin/install` creates the managed workspace directory from embedded resources and enables the plugin by default.
- Directories with `.builtin` are owned by DotCraft and can be updated or removed by DotCraft lifecycle operations.
- Directories without `.builtin` are treated as user-owned and are not overwritten or removed by DotCraft.

`plugin/remove` deletes only managed built-in directories that still carry the `.builtin` marker. Removing a plugin is distinct from disabling it: removed built-ins are absent from runtime discovery but remain visible in the installable catalog, while disabled installed plugins remain on disk and can be re-enabled.

---

## 7. TypeScript External Channel Modules

A TypeScript external channel module is the SDK-facing unit that represents one external channel integration variant, such as a first-party Feishu module or an enterprise Feishu module.

Hosts integrate modules through a stable module contract rather than package-internal source layout. A module owns platform protocol integration, platform-specific configuration, lifecycle behavior, runtime tool registration, and tool execution. The host owns discovery, workspace context, configuration storage, launcher lifecycle, and user-visible enablement.

The module contract defines:

- **Module identity**: stable `moduleId`, channel family, display metadata, optional UI interface metadata, variant semantics, and capability summary.
- **Manifest carrier**: a module-root SDK export that exposes host-readable module metadata.
- **Entry contract**: a documented startup entry that receives workspace context and returns a structured startup outcome.
- **Workspace context**: workspace path, `.craft` path, config path, state path, temp path, and AppServer connection information.
- **Configuration contract**: workspace-scoped configuration stored under `.craft/<configFileName>`, with module-owned validation and host-visible descriptors.
- **State and temp layout**: module-owned persistent state and temporary runtime files scoped to the active workspace.
- **Lifecycle contract**: structured statuses, errors, diagnostics, interactive setup needs, and restart requirements.
- **Capability and tool registration**: manifest-level capability summaries plus runtime channel tool descriptors declared during AppServer `initialize`.

Desktop may expose discoverable channel modules in the Channels workflow, but listing modules must not require executing module business logic. Bundled and user-installed modules can coexist; user-installed content wins when both provide the same `moduleId`.

Module manifests may include an optional `interface` object for host-rendered discovery and detail surfaces. It is display-only metadata and must not affect runtime startup. The recognized fields are:

- `shortDescription` / `localizedShortDescription`: compact list subtitle and brief detail subtitle.
- `longDescription` / `localizedLongDescription`: richer detail-page description.
- `previewPrompt` / `localizedPreviewPrompt`: short sample prompt or collaboration phrase for visual previews.

Localized `interface` maps use the same locale keys as other module display metadata: `en` and `zh-Hans`.

---

## 8. Configuration

The `Plugins` config section contains:

- `PluginRoots`: additional local plugin roots or plugin container directories. Relative paths resolve against the workspace root.
- `EnabledPlugins`: plugin ids explicitly enabled for the workspace.
- `DisabledPlugins`: plugin ids explicitly disabled for the workspace. Disabled entries override enabled/default entries.

Installed built-in plugins and local manifest plugins are enabled by default unless disabled. Built-ins that are visible only through the catalog are installable but not enabled and do not contribute tools or skills to agent context.

`node-repl` in `DisabledPlugins` is treated as a legacy alias for `browser-use`; new writes normalize to `browser-use`.

Workspace-level MCP configuration continues to use `McpServers`. Plugin-bundled MCP servers are contributed by enabled plugins and merged into the effective MCP runtime configuration as read-only runtime entries. Desktop and other clients should show plugin MCP alongside workspace MCP in runtime settings, but edits and deletes apply only to workspace-origin entries.

## 9. Protocol Boundaries

- AppServer JSON-RPC methods and capability negotiation are defined in [AppServer Protocol](appserver-protocol.md).
- Session item payloads, including `pluginFunctionCall`, are defined in [Session Core](session-core.md).
- External channel adapter handshake, delivery, and `ext/channel/*` requests are defined in [External Channel Adapter](external-channel-adapter.md).
- Desktop user-facing module workflows are defined in [Desktop Client](desktop-client.md).
