## 1. Scope

### 1.1 What This Spec Defines

This specification defines the wire protocol — message formats, methods, notifications, and transport rules — that a DotCraft server exposes to external clients over stdio or WebSocket. It is primarily the network-facing projection of the Session Core `ISessionService` API, and additionally covers server-level management operations that are exposed on the same JSON-RPC surface.

### 1.2 What This Spec Does Not Define

- **Domain model semantics**: Thread, Turn, and Item lifecycle rules, persistence layout, and state machine invariants are defined in the [Session Core Specification](session-core.md). This spec references them but does not redefine them.
- **Agent execution internals**: Model orchestration, tool invocation internals, hook execution, and other host-side implementation details are not part of this wire protocol.
- **Channel-specific UX**: How a client renders events, approvals, or status is a client concern.
- **Host implementation patterns**: In-process adapter wiring, dependency injection structure, persistence layout, and runtime service composition are internal to the server and not part of this wire protocol.

### 1.3 Design Reference

This protocol is modeled after the [Codex App Server](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs/app-server) JSON-RPC protocol, adapted to DotCraft's domain model. The Thread/Turn/Item primitives, event streaming, and bidirectional approval flow follow the same patterns described in [Unlocking the Codex Harness](https://openai.com/index/unlocking-the-codex-harness/).

### 1.4 V1 Contract Snapshot

The current v1 contract is based on the refactored Session Core, not on the earlier draft assumptions. For implementation planning, features fall into three buckets:

| Bucket | V1 Items |
|-------|----------|
| **Guaranteed in v1** | Rich approval decisions (`accept`, `acceptForSession`, `acceptAlways`, `decline`, `cancel`), thread-scoped event subscription, accurate per-turn origin/initiator metadata, strict `historyMode` rules, separate wire DTO serialization with camelCase enums and lossless delta typing. Cron management methods (`cron/list`, `cron/remove`, `cron/enable`, `cron/run`) with the `cronManagement` server capability flag. Heartbeat trigger method (`heartbeat/trigger`) with the `heartbeatManagement` capability flag. Skills management methods (`skills/list`, `skills/read`, `skills/view`, `skills/restoreOriginal`, `skills/setEnabled`, `skills/uninstall`) with the `skillsManagement` / `skillVariants` capability flags. Command management methods (`command/list`, `command/execute`) with the `commandManagement` capability flag. Channel status method (`channel/status`) with the `channelStatus` capability flag. Model catalog method (`model/list`) with the `modelCatalogManagement` capability flag. MCP management methods (`mcp/list`, `mcp/get`, `mcp/upsert`, `mcp/remove`, `mcp/status/list`, `mcp/test`) with the `mcpManagement` / `mcpStatus` capability flags. External channel management methods (`externalChannel/list`, `externalChannel/get`, `externalChannel/upsert`, `externalChannel/remove`) with the `externalChannelManagement` capability flag. SubAgent profile management methods (`subagent/profiles/list`, `subagent/settings/update`, `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`, `subagent/profiles/upsert`, `subagent/profiles/remove`) with the `subAgentManagement` capability flag. Session-backed SubAgent child-thread listing/close/resume with the `subAgentSessions` capability flag. Workspace config update method (`workspace/config/update`) with the `workspaceConfigManagement` capability flag. |
| **Guaranteed with narrowed semantics** | `thread/list` is deterministic but **not cursor-paginated** in v1; archived threads are excluded by default and included only via an explicit filter. |
| **Deferred from v1** | Structured extension capability registry beyond a flat namespace advertisement. Clients must treat extension namespaces as optional and discoverable, not required for core Session behavior. |

**Multi-client thread lists**: In deployments with multiple concurrent connections, server-broadcast notifications in [Section 6.1](#61-thread-notifications) include `thread/started`, `thread/deleted`, `thread/renamed`, and `thread/runtimeChanged` so clients can keep both thread lists and per-thread activity indicators (running, waiting-on-approval, waiting-on-plan-confirmation) synchronized without polling or subscribing to every thread's event stream.

---

## 2. Protocol Fundamentals

### 2.1 JSON-RPC 2.0

The wire protocol uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** with the `"jsonrpc": "2.0"` header included on every message.

Three message kinds:

| Kind | Has `id` | Has `method` | Direction |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Request | yes | yes | either |
| Response | yes | no | reply to request |
| Notification | no | yes | either |

- **Client-to-server requests**: thread and turn lifecycle operations.
- **Server-to-client notifications**: event stream (thread/turn/item events).
- **Server-to-client requests**: approval prompts that require a client response.
- **Client-to-server notifications**: `initialized` handshake acknowledgement.

### 2.2 Transports

| Transport | Wire Format | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| stdio | Newline-delimited JSON (JSONL): one complete JSON-RPC message per line, UTF-8 encoded, over stdin (client→server) and stdout (server→client). | Primary |
| WebSocket | One JSON-RPC message per WebSocket text frame. | Experimental |

**stdio transport**: The server reads JSON-RPC requests from `stdin` and writes responses/notifications to `stdout`. Diagnostic and log output goes to `stderr`. Stdio is a 1:1 transport — exactly one client per server process.

**WebSocket transport**: When listening on `ws://HOST:PORT/ws`, the server supports multiple concurrent client connections. Each connection is fully independent and maintains its own initialization state and thread subscriptions. Full behavior is specified in [Section 15](#15-websocket-transport).

### 2.3 Serialization Rules

- All JSON property names use **camelCase** (e.g., `threadId`, `tokenUsage`, `approvalType`).
- Timestamps are **ISO 8601 UTC** strings (e.g., `"2026-03-15T10:00:00Z"`).
- Enums are serialized as **camelCase strings** (e.g., `"active"`, `"running"`, `"toolCall"`, `"waitingApproval"`).
- Nullable fields are omitted from the JSON when `null`, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- Wire DTOs are distinct from the on-disk persistence models. Persisted thread JSON may keep internal compatibility quirks; the wire contract must remain lossless and transport-stable.
- AppServer projects Session Core `item/delta` events to specific wire methods (`item/agentMessage/delta`, `item/reasoning/delta`, `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta`, `item/commandExecution/outputDelta`). Delta notifications that can represent multiple logical kinds carry `deltaKind`.
- `id` fields in JSON-RPC messages may be strings or integers. The server preserves the type and value when responding.

---

## 3. Initialization

### 3.1 Handshake

The client must send an `initialize` request as the very first message on a new connection. Any other method sent before initialization is rejected with error code `-32002` (`"Not initialized"`). Repeated `initialize` calls on the same connection are rejected with error code `-32003` (`"Already initialized"`).

After receiving the `initialize` response, the client must send an `initialized` notification to signal readiness. The server may begin sending notifications (e.g., for in-progress threads) after receiving `initialized`.

```
Client                              Server
  |                                   |
  | initialize (request, id: 0)      |
  |---------------------------------->|
  |                                   |
  | (response, id: 0)                |
  |<----------------------------------|
  |                                   |
  | initialized (notification)        |
  |---------------------------------->|
  |                                   |
  | (protocol ready, both directions) |
```

### 3.2 `initialize`

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

```json
{
  "clientInfo": {
    "name": "dotcraft-client",

          },
          "deferLoading": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `clientInfo.name` | string | yes | Machine-readable client identifier. |
| `clientInfo.title` | string | no | Human-readable client name. |
| `clientInfo.version` | string | yes | Client version string. |
| `capabilities.approvalSupport` | boolean | no | Whether the client can handle server-initiated approval requests. Default `true`. |
| `capabilities.streamingSupport` | boolean | no | Whether the client can consume `item/*/delta` notifications. Default `true`. |
| `capabilities.commandExecutionStreaming` | boolean | no | Whether the client can consume `commandExecution` items and `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` notifications. Default `false`. |
| `capabilities.toolExecutionLifecycle` | boolean | no | Whether the client can consume `toolExecution` lifecycle items for per-call runtime completion. Default `false`. |
| `capabilities.backgroundTerminals` | boolean | no | Whether the client can consume `terminal/*` background terminal notifications. Default `false`. |
| `capabilities.configChange` | boolean | no | Whether the client wants `workspace/configChanged` notifications. Default `true`. |
| `capabilities.optOutNotificationMethods` | string[] | no | Exact notification method names to suppress for this connection. See [Section 10](#10-notification-opt-out). |
| `capabilities.channelAdapter` | object | no | External channel adapter metadata. When present, the connection is treated as the remote backend for one unified channel runtime. See [external-channel-adapter.md](external-channel-adapter.md). |
| `capabilities.acpExtensions` | object | no | ACP tool proxy capabilities. When present, the client can handle server-initiated `ext/acp/*` requests. See [Section 11.2](#112-acp-tool-proxy). Default omitted (no ACP support). |
| `capabilities.nodeRepl` | object | no | Desktop persistent Node REPL capability. When present with `browserUse`, the client can handle server-initiated `ext/nodeRepl/*` requests for thread-bound local browser automation. Default omitted (no browser-use support). |
| `capabilities.browserUse` | object | no | Desktop embedded browser IAB capability. When present with `nodeRepl`, the Node REPL is backed by Desktop browser tabs, CDP-style page state, screenshots, coordinate input, virtual mouse state, console logs, and named tab sessions. Default omitted (no browser-use support). |

`capabilities.configChange` is an opt-out capability. When omitted, the server treats it as `true` and may push `workspace/configChanged` notifications. Modern clients should declare it explicitly for clarity, even when using the default behavior.

**`acpExtensions` object** (when present):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `fsReadTextFile` | boolean | Client can handle `ext/acp/fs/readTextFile`. |
| `fsWriteTextFile` | boolean | Client can handle `ext/acp/fs/writeTextFile`. |
| `terminalCreate` | boolean | Client can handle `ext/acp/terminal/*` methods. |
| `extensions` | string[] | Custom extension families the client implements (e.g. `["_unity"]`). Server may send `ext/acp/<family>/<method>` for each advertised family. |

**`nodeRepl` object** (when present):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `backend` | string | Client runtime identifier, currently `desktop-node`. |

**`browserUse` object** (when present):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `backend` | string | Client browser backend identifier, currently `desktop-iab`. |
| `protocolVersion` | number | Browser-use IAB protocol version. Current value is `2`. |
| `supportsCancel` | boolean | Optional. When `true`, the client handles `ext/nodeRepl/cancel` for in-flight evaluations. |

**`channelAdapter` object** (when present):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `channelName` | string | Canonical external channel name (for example `telegram`, `feishu`). |
| `deliveryCapabilities` | object | Structured delivery capability descriptor for the remote backend. |
| `channelTools` | array | Optional channel tool descriptors declared by the adapter during `initialize`. These descriptors are the wire projection of the unified channel tool model. |

**`deliveryCapabilities` object**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `structuredDelivery` | boolean | Whether the adapter can receive `ext/channel/send`. |
| `media` | object | Optional media capability map keyed by delivery kind (`file`, `audio`, `image`, `video`). |

Each media capability entry supports:

- `maxBytes?: number`
- `allowedMimeTypes?: string[]`
- `allowedExtensions?: string[]`
- `supportsHostPath: boolean`
- `supportsUrl: boolean`
- `supportsBase64: boolean`
- `supportsCaption: boolean`

Each `channelTools` descriptor supports:

- `name: string`
- `description: string`
- `inputSchema: object`
- `outputSchema?: object`
- `display?: { icon?: string, title?: string, subtitle?: string }`
- `requiresChatContext: boolean`
- `approval?: { kind: string, targetArgument: string, operation?: string, operationArgument?: string }`
- `deferLoading?: boolean`

Channel tool names should use PascalCase. For cross-runtime icon support, adapters should prefer declaring emoji icons via `channelTools[].display.icon`.

`deferLoading` is currently a reserved wire field. Adapters may send it for forward compatibility, but the server does not apply special lazy-loading behavior.

When `approval` is present, it is a descriptive risk declaration rather than an adapter-owned policy block:

- `approval.kind` identifies the server approval category. Initial standard values are `file`, `shell`, and `remoteResource`. `remoteResource` targets non-local resources (e.g. third-party SaaS documents or wiki nodes); the server asks the user once and does not run path/command parsing for it.
- `approval.targetArgument` names the tool argument that contains the primary approval target, such as `filePath` or `workingDirectory`.
- `approval.operation` is an optional static label forwarded to the server approval layer.
- `approval.operationArgument` is an optional argument name whose value is forwarded as the operation string.
- Policy resolution remains server-owned. The adapter must not treat descriptor metadata as a private approval configuration source.

### 3.2.1 Unified Channel Model

DotCraft internally models built-in channels and external adapters through the same runtime concepts:

- `ChannelDeliveryCapabilities`
- `ChannelToolDescriptor`
- `ChannelOutboundMessage`
- `ExtChannelToolCallContext` (unified channel execution context)
- `ExtChannelToolCallResult` (unified channel tool result)

Built-in channels do not negotiate these capabilities over `initialize`; they provide equivalent runtime objects in-process. External adapters expose the same model through `capabilities.channelAdapter`, `ext/channel/send`, and `ext/channel/toolCall`.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "serverInfo": {
    "name": "dotcraft",
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "protocolVersion": "1",
    "extensions": ["acp"]
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "threadManagement": true,
    "threadSubscriptions": true,
    "approvalFlow": true,
    "modeSwitch": true,
    "configOverride": true,
    "cronManagement": true,
    "heartbeatManagement": true,
    "skillsManagement": true,
    "pluginManagement": true,
    "skillVariants": true,
    "commandManagement": true,
    "modelCatalogManagement": true,
    "workspaceConfigManagement": true,
    "mcpManagement": true,
    "mcpServerOrigins": true,
    "externalChannelManagement": true,
    "mcpStatus": true,
    "extensions": {
      "welcomeSuggestions": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `serverInfo.name` | string | Always `"dotcraft"`. |
| `serverInfo.version` | string | DotCraft server version. |
| `serverInfo.protocolVersion` | string | Wire protocol version. Currently `"1"`. |
| `serverInfo.extensions` | string[] | Optional flat list of available extension namespaces. Structured extension capability metadata is deferred from v1. |
| `capabilities.threadManagement` | boolean | Server supports thread CRUD operations. |
| `capabilities.threadSubscriptions` | boolean | Server supports passive `thread/subscribe` observers independent from `turn/start`. |
| `capabilities.threadGoals` | boolean | Server supports the complete thread goal runtime contract: `thread/goal/*` control methods, goal notifications, prompt-visible goal context, usage accounting, budget transitions, and model goal tools. Automatic idle continuation still depends on server config. |
| `capabilities.manualCompaction` | boolean | Server supports manual context compaction with `thread/compact/start`. |
| `capabilities.manualMemoryConsolidation` | boolean | Server supports manual long-term memory consolidation with `thread/memory/consolidate/start`. |
| `capabilities.approvalFlow` | boolean | Server may send approval requests. |
| `capabilities.modeSwitch` | boolean | Server supports `thread/mode/set`. |
| `capabilities.configOverride` | boolean | Server supports `thread/config/update`. |
| `capabilities.cronManagement` | boolean | Server supports cron job management methods (`cron/list`, `cron/remove`, `cron/enable`, `cron/run`). Absent or `false` when the cron service is not configured. |
| `capabilities.heartbeatManagement` | boolean | Server supports heartbeat management methods (`heartbeat/trigger`). Absent or `false` when the heartbeat service is not configured. |
| `capabilities.skillsManagement` | boolean | Server supports skills management methods (`skills/list`, `skills/read`, `skills/view`, `skills/restoreOriginal`, `skills/setEnabled`, `skills/uninstall`). |
| `capabilities.pluginManagement` | boolean | Server supports plugin management methods (`plugin/list`, `plugin/view`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/remove`, `plugin/setEnabled`). |
| `capabilities.skillVariants` | boolean | Server has skill variants enabled for the current runtime. Clients may use effective skill views and restore source-skill behavior (`skills/view`, `skills/restoreOriginal`) without exposing variant internals. |
| `capabilities.commandManagement` | boolean | Server supports command management methods (`command/list`, `command/execute`). |
| `capabilities.modelCatalogManagement` | boolean | Server supports model catalog methods (`model/list`). |
| `capabilities.workspaceConfigManagement` | boolean | Server supports workspace configuration methods (`workspace/config/schema`, `workspace/config/update`). |
| `capabilities.memoryManagement` | boolean | Server supports workspace memory management methods (`memory/reset`). |
| `capabilities.mcpManagement` | boolean | Server supports MCP configuration management methods (`mcp/list`, `mcp/get`, `mcp/upsert`, `mcp/remove`). |
| `capabilities.mcpServerOrigins` | boolean | Server annotates MCP config/status DTOs with `origin` and `readOnly` so clients can show plugin-bundled MCP servers as read-only runtime entries. |
| `capabilities.externalChannelManagement` | boolean | Server supports external channel configuration management methods (`externalChannel/list`, `externalChannel/get`, `externalChannel/upsert`, `externalChannel/remove`). |
| `capabilities.subAgentManagement` | boolean | Server supports SubAgent profile management methods (`subagent/profiles/list`, `subagent/settings/update`, `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`, `subagent/profiles/upsert`, `subagent/profiles/remove`). |
| `capabilities.mcpStatus` | boolean | Server supports MCP runtime status methods and notifications (`mcp/status/list`, `mcp/status/updated`, `mcp/test`). |
| `capabilities.extensions` | object | Optional module capability registry keyed by extension name. Each value is extension-defined metadata; boolean `true` means the extension methods are available. Example: `capabilities.extensions.welcomeSuggestions = true` advertises support for `welcome/suggestions`. |

### 3.3 `initialized`

**Direction**: client → server (notification, no `id`)

**Params**: `{}` (empty object)

No response. Signals the client is ready to receive notifications.

---

## 4. Thread Methods

Thread methods correspond to `ISessionService` thread lifecycle operations defined in the [Session Core Specification, Section 5.1](session-core.md#51-thread-lifecycle).

### 4.1 `thread/start`

Create a new thread. The server generates a Thread ID and persists initial state.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | SessionIdentity | yes | Channel identity for thread ownership. See [Session Core, Section 4.1.4](session-core.md#414-sessionidentity). |
| `config` | ThreadConfiguration | no | Per-thread agent configuration. Null means workspace defaults. |
| `dynamicTools` | DynamicToolSpec[] | no | Thread-scoped runtime tools implemented by the AppServer client that creates the thread. |
| `historyMode` | string | no | `"server"` (default) or `"client"`. |
| `displayName` | string | no | Explicit thread display name. |

#### 4.1.0 Runtime Dynamic Tools

`dynamicTools` lets an AppServer client expose thread-scoped callback tools to the agent. The tools are bound to the connection that creates the thread and are invoked through the server-to-client `item/tool/call` request. They are not plugin manifest tools and are not a general remote tool transport; external reusable services should use MCP.

Dynamic tool spec:

```json
{
  "namespace": "oratorio",
  "name": "SubmitReviewDraft",
  "description": "Submit a structured code review draft.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "body": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "required": ["body"]
  },
  "deferLoading": false,
  "approval": {
    "kind": "remoteResource",
    "targetArgument": "body",
    "operation": "submit-review-draft"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `name` and `description` are required.
- `namespace` is optional. When present it must be non-empty after trimming.
- `inputSchema` is required and must be a valid JSON Schema object.
- `(namespace, name)` pairs must be unique within a `thread/start` request.
- `approval`, when present, uses the same descriptive approval metadata as channel tools: `file`, `shell`, or `remoteResource`. DotCraft evaluates approval before dispatching `item/tool/call`.
- If the creating connection closes, dynamic tools bound to that thread become unavailable and calls fail with a structured failed `dynamicToolCall` item.

#### 4.1.1 `ThreadConfiguration` Wire Shape

`ThreadConfiguration` is the canonical thread-scoped configuration object on the wire:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [],
  "mode": "agent",
  "extensions": ["_unity"],
  "customTools": ["SomeTool"],
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "workspaceOverride": "/path/to/alt/workspace",
  "toolProfile": "commit-message",
  "useToolProfileOnly": false,
  "agentInstructions": "Focus on concise commit messages.",
  "approvalPolicy": "default",
  "automationTaskDirectory": "/path/to/task",
  "requireApprovalOutsideWorkspace": true
}
```

Fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `mcpServers` | `McpServerConfig[]` | Optional per-thread MCP server configuration. |
| `mode` | string | Agent mode for the thread. Default `agent`. |
| `extensions` | string[] | Optional active ACP extension prefixes. |
| `customTools` | string[] | Optional extra tool names enabled for the thread. |
| `model` | string | Optional per-thread model override. |
| `workspaceOverride` | string | Optional alternate workspace root for the thread. |
| `toolProfile` | string | Optional named tool profile. |
| `useToolProfileOnly` | boolean | When `true`, use only the tools from `toolProfile`. |
| `agentInstructions` | string | Optional additional system instructions. |
| `approvalPolicy` | string | Thread-scoped approval mode: `default`, `autoApprove`, or `interrupt`. `default` means the thread consults the workspace default approval policy. |
| `automationTaskDirectory` | string | Optional local automation task directory. |
| `requireApprovalOutsideWorkspace` | boolean | Optional override for the workspace file/shell outside-boundary behavior. |

Approval semantics:

- `approvalPolicy = default` uses the workspace default approval policy. If the workspace default is also `default` or unset, the server uses the normal interactive approval flow when the client supports approvals.
- `approvalPolicy = autoApprove` auto-accepts approval-gated operations for that thread.
- `approvalPolicy = interrupt` cancels the turn when an approval-gated operation is encountered.
- `requireApprovalOutsideWorkspace = true` allows outside-workspace file/shell operations to proceed through the approval service.
- `requireApprovalOutsideWorkspace = false` rejects outside-workspace file/shell operations without prompting.
- `requireApprovalOutsideWorkspace` omitted means the server uses workspace defaults.

`SessionIdentity` on the wire:

```json
{
  "channelName": "vscode",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "channelContext": "workspace:/path/to/project",
  "workspacePath": "/path/to/project"
}
```

**Result**:

```json
{
  "thread": {
    "id": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
    "workspacePath": "/path/to/project",
    "userId": "user-123",
    "originChannel": "vscode",
    "displayName": null,
    "status": "active",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-16T10:00:00Z",
    "lastActiveAt": "2026-03-16T10:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {},
    "turns": []
  }
}
```

The server also emits a `thread/started` notification after the response.

In a shared Session Core process (typical AppServer mode), when **any** channel creates a thread (not only via `thread/start` on this connection), the server **broadcasts** the same `thread/started` notification to connected clients. For ordinary `thread/start` RPCs, the initiating client may receive the post-response notification from the request handler instead of the shared broadcast and should dedupe by thread id. Session-backed SubAgent child threads are always broadcast to the current connection as well, because their creation happens inside a parent turn/tool call and has no direct `thread/start` response.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "thread/start", "id": 1, "params": {
    "identity": {
      "channelName": "vscode",
      "userId": "user-123",
      "channelContext": "workspace:/home/dev/myproject",
      "workspacePath": "/home/dev/myproject"
    },
    "historyMode": "server"
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": {
    "thread": {
      "id": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
      "status": "active",
      "workspacePath": "/home/dev/myproject",
      "createdAt": "2026-03-16T10:00:00Z",
      "lastActiveAt": "2026-03-16T10:00:00Z",
      "turns": []
    }
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "thread/started", "params": {
    "thread": { "id": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4", "status": "active" }
} }
```

### 4.2 `thread/resume`

Resume a paused or previously loaded thread. Session Core loads the thread from persistence, reconstructs the agent session, and sets status to Active.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to resume. |

**Result**: `{ "thread": Thread }` — the resumed thread object.

The server emits a `thread/resumed` notification.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "thread/resume", "id": 2, "params": {
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4"
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "result": {
    "thread": { "id": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4", "status": "active" }
} }
```

### 4.3 `thread/list`

List threads matching a given identity.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | SessionIdentity | yes | Identity to filter by. |
| `includeArchived` | boolean | no | Default `false`. When `true`, archived threads are included in the result set alongside non-archived threads. |
| `includeSubAgents` | boolean | no | Default `false`. When `true`, session-backed subagent child threads may be included in the mixed result set. Children whose parent is archived are still hidden unless `includeArchived` is also true. Widget-style clients should prefer `subagent/children/list` for a parent thread. |
| `includeInternal` | boolean | no | Default `false`. When `false`, DotCraft-owned helper threads marked with `dotcraft.internal` metadata or known internal origins are excluded. This should only be enabled by diagnostics. |
| `crossChannelOrigins` | string[] \| null | no | When **omitted** or JSON `null`, no cross-channel origin list is applied. When present as an array (possibly empty), non-empty values additionally return threads whose `originChannel` is in the list with the same `workspacePath` and `userId` as `identity`, ignoring `channelContext`. See [Session Core §9.5](session-core.md#95-cross-channel-resume-protocol). |
| `channelName` | string | no | When set, post-filters results to threads whose persisted `originChannel` matches (case-insensitive). Same as existing filter. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
      "displayName": "Fix login bug",
      "status": "active",
      "originChannel": "vscode",
      "createdAt": "2026-03-16T10:00:00Z",
      "lastActiveAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:00Z",
      "runtime": {
        "running": true,
        "waitingOnApproval": false,
        "waitingOnPlanConfirmation": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Results are ordered by `lastActiveAt` descending. Cursor pagination is deferred from v1 because the current Core only guarantees deterministic full-list ordering.

Each `ThreadSummary` may include an optional `runtime` snapshot with the same shape as `thread/runtimeChanged`. This snapshot is best-effort process-local state intended to hydrate thread-list activity indicators after reconnect. Clients should apply it as initial list state and continue to consume `thread/runtimeChanged` as the incremental source of truth. Older servers may omit `runtime`, and clients must treat omission as unknown rather than as an idle thread.

### 4.3.1 `channel/list`

Lists discoverable **origin channel** names that may appear in thread metadata. No Session Core query is required; this is server-derived discovery metadata.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**: `{}` (empty object) or omitted — no required fields.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "channels": [
    { "name": "cli", "category": "builtin" },
    { "name": "qq", "category": "social" },
    { "name": "telegram", "category": "external" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Canonical `originChannel` string (case as stored). |
| `category` | `builtin`, `social`, `system`, or `external`. |

**Semantics**:

- The result contains server-known origin channels that may appear on persisted threads or be accepted by related APIs.
- Server-defined channels may be categorized as `builtin`, `social`, or `system`; externally configured channels may be categorized as `external`.
- Internal-only origins that are not intended for cross-channel discovery may be omitted.
- Results are sorted by category order (builtin → social → system → external), then by `name` (ordinal case-insensitive).

### 4.4 `thread/read`

Read a thread by ID without resuming it. Optionally includes turn history.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to read. |
| `includeTurns` | boolean | no | If `true`, include the full `turns` array. Default `false`. |

**Result**: `{ "thread": Thread }` — the thread object, with `turns` populated if requested.

**Semantics**: `thread/read` is a **read-only** operation. It does not by itself resume execution, start background services, or apply execution-time thread configuration.

The `Thread` wire object includes `queuedInputs?: QueuedTurnInput[]`. This queue is returned regardless of `includeTurns`, because it is current thread state rather than historical turn detail.

**`contextUsage` field**: When the server has persisted context-window occupancy for the thread, the returned `Thread` carries an optional `contextUsage` snapshot for the desktop token ring. This snapshot is not billing usage and must not be derived from cumulative `Turn.tokenUsage` totals or message-history estimation:

```
"contextUsage": {
  "tokens": number,                // Approximate input tokens currently occupying context
  "contextWindow": number,         // Effective context window for the thread's effective model (denominator)
  "autoCompactThreshold": number,  // Token count at which auto-compact runs
  "warningThreshold": number,      // Token count at which compactWarning starts firing
  "errorThreshold": number,        // Token count at which compactError starts firing
  "percentLeft": number            // Fraction of the context window still available (0.0 - 1.0)
}
```

The same snapshot is also embedded on `thread/start` and `thread/resume` responses (and their matching `thread/started` / `thread/resumed` notifications) so clients can seed the token ring without an extra round-trip. When `Compaction.ContextWindow` is inferred from the model catalog, `contextWindow` is computed from the thread's effective model, including `Thread.configuration.model` overrides. Freshly-created threads initialize persisted context usage to `tokens = 0`; the field is omitted only for older threads or hosts that have no persisted context usage state yet.

### 4.5 `thread/rollback`

Drop one or more turns from the end of a thread's canonical history.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "numTurns": 1
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "thread": { "id": "thread_...", "turns": [] }
}
```

`numTurns` must be `>= 1`. The target thread must not be archived and must not contain a `running` or `waitingApproval` turn. Rollback only changes conversation history; it does not revert workspace files, command output, or other side effects produced by the dropped turns. The response includes the updated thread with turns/items so clients can replace local conversation state.

### 4.6 `thread/subscribe`

Subscribe the current connection to future lifecycle events for a thread. Multiple passive subscribers may observe the same thread concurrently.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread to observe. |
| `replayRecent` | boolean | no | Default `false`. When `true`, the server may replay a small recent buffer for reconnect smoothing. |

**Result**: `{}`

After subscription succeeds, the server may emit future `thread/*`, `turn/*`, and `item/*` notifications for that thread even when the current connection did not originate the turn.

### 4.7 `thread/unsubscribe`

Remove the current connection's passive subscription to a thread.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread to stop observing. |

**Result**: `{}`

Cancellation of the transport connection also implicitly unsubscribes all active thread subscriptions owned by that connection.

### 4.8 `thread/pause`

Pause an active thread. A paused thread cannot accept new turns until resumed.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to pause. |

**Result**: `{}`

The server emits a `thread/statusChanged` notification.

### 4.9 `thread/archive`

Archive a thread. Archived threads are read-only — they can be listed and read but not resumed or turned. If the target is a top-level parent with session-backed SubAgent descendants, the server recursively archives the full child-thread subtree. Directly archiving a SubAgent child thread is invalid; callers manage it through its parent.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to archive. |

**Result**: `{}`

The server emits a `thread/statusChanged` notification.

### 4.10 `thread/unarchive`

Restore an archived thread to Active status so it can appear in the normal active thread list again. If the target is a top-level parent with session-backed SubAgent descendants, the server recursively restores the full child-thread subtree.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to restore. |

**Result**: `{}`

The server emits a `thread/statusChanged` notification with `newStatus: "active"`.

### 4.11 `thread/delete`

Permanently delete a thread, its associated session data, and all tracing sessions/events bound to that thread. If the target is a top-level parent with session-backed SubAgent descendants, the server recursively deletes the full child-thread subtree and its graph edges. Directly deleting a SubAgent child thread is invalid; callers manage it through its parent.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID to delete. |

**Result**: `{}`

After the thread is permanently removed, the server **broadcasts** a `thread/deleted` notification to **all** connected clients (see Section 6.1). For recursive SubAgent deletion, a notification is emitted for each removed thread. Deletion is only considered successful after the persisted thread record and all bound tracing data have been removed. Clients that initiated `thread/delete` on this connection may remove the thread from local state when the RPC returns; receiving `thread/deleted` afterward is idempotent.

### 4.12 `thread/mode/set`

Set the agent mode for a thread (e.g., `"plan"`, `"agent"`).

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |
| `mode` | string | yes | New agent mode. |

**Result**: `{}`

**Behavior**: The server recreates the execution context for the specified thread using the tool set associated with the requested mode.

### 4.13 `thread/rename`

Update the display name of a thread.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |
| `displayName` | string | yes | New display name for the thread. |

**Result**: `{}`

After the display name is persisted, the server **broadcasts** a `thread/renamed` notification to **all** connected clients (see [Section 6.1](#61-thread-notifications)). The same notification is used when Session Core sets the display name from the first user message on a turn (not only in response to this RPC).

### 4.14 `thread/config/update`

Update per-thread agent configuration (MCP servers, extensions, etc.).

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |
| `config` | ThreadConfiguration | yes | Configuration patch. |

**Result**: `{}`

---

### 4.15 Thread Goal Methods

Thread goal behavior is defined by [Goal Design](goal-design.md). AppServer projects the Session Core goal runtime through these JSON-RPC methods:

| Method | Params | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `thread/goal/get` | `{ threadId }` | `{ goal: ThreadGoal? }` |
| `thread/goal/set` | `{ threadId, objective?, status?, tokenBudget?, mode? }` | `{ goal: ThreadGoal }` |
| `thread/goal/clear` | `{ threadId }` | `{ cleared: boolean }` |

Clients must check `capabilities.threadGoals` before calling these methods. When absent or false, servers return method-not-found or a capability error.

`thread/goal/set.mode` defaults to `"upsertOrUpdate"` and may be `"replaceExisting"`, `"createOnly"`, or `"updateOnly"`. `status` values are `"active"`, `"paused"`, `"budgetLimited"`, and `"complete"`. Interactive clients should confirm before replacing a different non-complete objective; the server still enforces authoritative state transitions.

`ThreadGoal` uses the normal wire casing:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "goalId": "goal_...",
  "objective": "Ship the feature",
  "status": "active",
  "tokenBudget": null,
  "tokensUsed": { "totalTokens": 0 },
  "timeUsedSeconds": 0,
  "createdAt": "2026-05-08T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-08T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Goal notifications:

| Notification | Params | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| `thread/goal/updated` | `{ threadId, turnId?, goal }` | `turnId` is present when a running turn caused the update, such as accounting or `UpdateGoal(complete)`. |
| `thread/goal/cleared` | `{ threadId }` | Emitted only when a goal was deleted. |

`thread/read`, `thread/start`, `thread/resume`, and `thread/list` may include an optional `goal` snapshot for hydration. Clients must still consume goal notifications as the incremental source of truth.

### 4.16 `thread/compact/start`

Manually compact the model-visible context for an idle server-managed thread.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |

**Result**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `outcome` | string | `"micro"`, `"partial"`, `"skipped"`, or `"failed"`. |
| `message` | string? | Optional skip/failure reason. |
| `contextUsage` | ContextUsageSnapshot? | Updated snapshot when available. |

Servers advertise this method with `capabilities.manualCompaction = true`. The method is valid only for Active, server-managed threads that have history and no `Running` / `WaitingApproval` turn. The server emits `system/event` in the order `compacting` → `compacted` / `compactSkipped` / `compactFailed`. Manual compaction first tries partial compaction; if there is no older prefix, or the partial attempt cannot produce a summary, it falls back to full-history compaction so short histories can still be compacted. On success it persists the compacted agent session and appends a `SystemNotice` item with `kind = "compacted"` and `trigger = "manual"` to the latest completed turn.

### 4.17 `thread/memory/consolidate/start`

Manually consolidate the current thread's model-visible history into workspace long-term memory.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |

**Result**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `outcome` | string | `"succeeded"`, `"skipped"`, or `"failed"`. |
| `message` | string? | Optional skip/failure reason. |
| `memoryWritten` | boolean | Whether `MEMORY.md` was updated. |
| `historyWritten` | boolean | Whether `HISTORY.md` was appended. |

Servers advertise this method with `capabilities.manualMemoryConsolidation = true`. The method is valid only for Active, server-managed, idle threads with at least one completed turn and non-empty model-visible history. Manual consolidation bypasses `Memory.AutoConsolidateEnabled` because it is an explicit user action, but it still requires the server to have a memory consolidator. The server emits `system/event` in the order `consolidating` → `consolidated` / `consolidationSkipped` / `consolidationFailed`. On success it persists a `SystemNotice` item with `kind = "memoryConsolidated"` into the latest completed turn.

---

## 5. Turn Methods

Turn methods correspond to `ISessionService` turn lifecycle operations defined in the [Session Core Specification, Section 5.2](session-core.md#52-turn-lifecycle).

### 5.1 `turn/start`

Submit user input to a thread and begin agent execution. The server creates a new Turn, records the user input as a `UserMessage` Item, and starts the agent.

Before starting the agent, the server **must** ensure the in-memory thread is loaded from persistence if needed and that any persisted `thread.configuration` (mode, MCP servers, etc.) is applied to the execution-time agent, so turns do not silently use workspace-default tooling after a cold load or when only `thread/read` was used earlier ([Session Core](session-core.md) `EnsureThreadLoaded`).

The response is returned **immediately** with the initial Turn object (status `"running"`, empty `items`). The agent's output then streams as notifications: `turn/started`, followed by `item/*` events, and finally `turn/completed` (or `turn/failed` / `turn/cancelled`).

For persisted server-managed threads, the execution lifecycle of a started turn is owned by the AppServer, not by the single request transport that submitted it. If the client WebSocket disconnects after `turn/start` has begun, the server must continue consuming the turn event stream so the turn can complete or fail normally. The disconnected client may miss notifications and should recover by reconnecting and calling `thread/read` or `thread/subscribe`.

**Interaction with `thread/subscribe`**: If the calling connection already holds an active subscription for the target thread (via `thread/subscribe`), the server MUST use the subscription path to deliver all turn-scoped notifications instead of creating a separate inline dispatch path. The `turn/start` JSON-RPC response is still sent before the first `turn/started` notification. The server must still keep an internal active-turn drain for the submitted turn so connection loss does not stop execution or strand approvals after the passive subscription is cancelled. See [Section 6.10](#610-notification-delivery-guarantees) for the at-most-once delivery guarantee.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Target thread. Must be `"active"` with no running turn. |
| `input` | InputPart[] | yes | User input. At least one part required. |
| `sender` | SenderContext | no | Sender identity for group sessions. |
| `messages` | ChatMessage[] | conditional | Required when the thread uses `historyMode = "client"`. Forbidden when the thread uses `historyMode = "server"`. |

`InputPart` is a tagged union:

- `{ "type": "text", "text": "..." }` — plain text input. `text` parts carry only literal user text; clients should not encode command, skill, or file-reference tags into `text` when a structured tag part exists.
- `{ "type": "commandRef", "name": "code-review", "argsText": "src/foo.cs", "rawText": "/code-review src/foo.cs" }` — native custom-command reference. The server materializes this reference before agent execution and persists both the native reference and the materialized prompt snapshot.
- `{ "type": "skillRef", "name": "browser" }` — native skill reference. The server materializes this reference into model-visible skill context while preserving the original `$skill` form for history rendering.
- `{ "type": "fileRef", "path": "src/foo.cs", "displayPath": "src/foo.cs" }` — native file reference. `path` is the canonical referenced path and may be workspace-relative or a local absolute path. `displayPath` is an optional UI-facing path when the server and client canonical forms differ. Referencing an outside-workspace path does not grant implicit access; later file reads still follow the server file-tool approval policy.
- `{ "type": "image", "url": "https://..." }` — remote image URL.
- `{ "type": "localImage", "path": "/tmp/screenshot.png", "mimeType": "image/png", "fileName": "screenshot.png" }` — local image file path with optional UI metadata.

Before starting the agent, the server MUST normalize the incoming `InputPart[]`, persist a `UserMessage` item whose payload captures both the native input parts and the materialized input parts, and only then convert the materialized parts into the `AIContent[]` passed to Session Core execution.

Tag semantics:

- `/command` denotes a custom command reference and is transmitted as `commandRef`.
- Built-in slash commands such as `/new`, `/stop`, `/help`, `/debug`, `/heartbeat`, and `/cron` are not valid `commandRef` values. Clients must trigger them via `command/execute` or dedicated UI controls. If a client sends a built-in command as `commandRef` in `turn/start`, the server rejects the request with `InvalidParams`.
- `$skill` denotes a skill reference and is transmitted as `skillRef`.
- `@path` denotes a file reference and is transmitted as `fileRef`.
- If a UI presents skills inside a slash-command picker, selecting a skill still produces a `skillRef`, not a `commandRef`.
- A composer slash-command picker that inserts `commandRef` parts should request custom commands only.

`localImage` optional metadata fields:

- `mimeType` (string, optional): client-observed MIME type for UI rehydration hints.
- `fileName` (string, optional): original filename from paste/drop context for UI display.

`QueuedTurnInput` uses the same input snapshot shape:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Queued input ID. |
| `threadId` | string | Parent thread ID. |
| `nativeInputParts` | InputPart[] | Original client input snapshot. |
| `materializedInputParts` | InputPart[] | Model-visible materialized snapshot. |
| `displayText` | string | Human-readable summary for queue UI. |
| `sender` | SenderContext? | Optional sender identity. |
| `status` | string | `"queued"` or `"guidancePending"`. |
| `createdAt` | string | UTC timestamp. |
| `readyAfterTurnId` | string? | Active turn observed when the input was queued. |

`SenderContext`:

```json
{
  "senderId": "user-456",
  "senderName": "Alice",
  "senderRole": "admin",
  "groupId": "group-123"
}
```

The server records two separate provenance fields:

- `thread.originChannel`: the channel that originally created the thread.
- `turn.originChannel`: the channel that initiated this specific turn.

Each persisted Turn also records an `initiator` object with durable actor metadata (`channelName`, `userId`, `userName`, `userRole`, `channelContext`, `groupId`) so cross-channel replay and auditing remain accurate after resume.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "turn": {
    "id": "turn_001",
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
    "status": "running",
    "items": [],
    "startedAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "turn/start", "id": 10, "params": {
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
    "input": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "Run the tests and fix any failures" }
    ]
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 10, "result": {
    "turn": {
      "id": "turn_001",
      "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
      "status": "running",
      "items": [],
      "startedAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:00Z"
    }
} }
```

### 5.2 `turn/interrupt`

Request cancellation of an in-progress turn. The server cancels the agent execution via `CancellationToken` and emits `turn/cancelled` once shutdown completes.

Before emitting `turn/cancelled`, the server finalizes any currently streaming agent/reasoning items with their accumulated text and persists the cancelled turn as canonical history. Future `turn/start` calls on server-managed threads must include the cancelled turn's user input and completed partial assistant output when rebuilding model context.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID. |
| `turnId` | string | yes | Turn ID to cancel. |

**Result**: `{}`

The actual cancellation is asynchronous. Rely on the `turn/cancelled` notification to know when the turn has stopped.

### 5.2.1 `turn/enqueue`

Persist user input in the thread FIFO queue. Desktop clients use this as the default send behavior while another Turn is running.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Target active thread. |
| `input` | InputPart[] | yes | Same input model as `turn/start`; at least one part required. |
| `sender` | SenderContext | no | Sender identity for group sessions. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "queuedInput": {
    "id": "queued_20260425100000000_ab12cd",
    "threadId": "thread_...",
    "displayText": "Run tests next",
    "status": "queued",
    "createdAt": "2026-04-25T10:00:00Z",
    "readyAfterTurnId": "turn_003"
  },
  "queuedInputs": [ ... ]
}
```

After enqueue, remove, or dequeue, the server emits `thread/queue/updated`.

### 5.2.2 `turn/queue/remove`

Remove one queued input without starting a Turn.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Target thread. |
| `queuedInputId` | string | yes | Queued input ID to remove. |

**Result**: `{ "queuedInputs": QueuedTurnInput[] }`

### 5.2.3 `turn/steer`

Promote a queued input into a pending guidance request for the current active Turn. This is not the default send path; clients should call it only when the user explicitly promotes a queued message into guidance.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Target active thread. |
| `expectedTurnId` | string | yes | Active Turn ID observed by the client. The server rejects the request if it no longer matches. |
| `queuedInputId` | string | yes | Queued input ID to promote. The server uses the persisted queued input snapshot as the source of truth. |
| `sender` | SenderContext | no | Sender identity for group sessions. |

**Result**: `{ "turnId": "<active-turn-id>", "queuedInputs": QueuedTurnInput[] }`

The server first marks the queued input as `guidancePending` and broadcasts `thread/queue/updated`; clients should keep the queue row visible in that state. When the model/tool loop reaches the next safe boundary, the server appends a `userMessage` item with `deliveryMode = "guidance"`, injects the input into the active Turn's model history, removes the queued input, and broadcasts `thread/queue/updated` again. If the Turn ends before insertion, the pending item returns to `queued`.

### 5.3 `workspace/commitMessage/suggest`

Suggest a git commit message from the **source thread’s** recent conversation context plus a **unified diff** for the given file paths. The AppServer runs an internal **temporary thread** (dedicated channel identity, commit-suggest-only tool) so this request does not contend with a user turn on the source thread.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Source thread whose messages supply context. Must belong to the server’s workspace. |
| `paths` | string[] | yes | Paths **relative to the workspace root** for `git diff`. Empty is invalid. |
| `maxDiffChars` | number | no | Optional cap on diff size sent to the model (server may truncate further). |

**Result**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `message` | string | Full commit message (first line subject; optional blank line and body). |

**Errors** (non-exhaustive): source thread not found; paths outside workspace; not a git repository; empty diff; model did not emit the `CommitSuggest` tool; timeout. If the server cannot run the suggest pipeline (e.g. no session service), it returns an appropriate JSON-RPC error.

**Note**: The server may create and delete an **ephemeral** thread for this operation. Clients may observe transient `thread/*` / `turn/*` notifications for that internal thread; implementations typically filter or ignore threads whose origin channel marks commit-message generation.

### 5.4 `welcome/suggestions`

Return welcome-screen quick suggestions for the current workspace. This method is intended for clients that render an empty or ready-to-start conversation state and want to show a small set of prompts that feel relevant to the user's recent work.

The result is advisory and read-only. The server derives these suggestions from workspace-scoped memory artifacts such as `MEMORY.md` and `HISTORY.md`; it should not inspect full conversation history on this path.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Capability advertisement**: clients should check `capabilities.extensions.welcomeSuggestions` before calling this method. If the capability is absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (`Method not found`) or an equivalent capability error.

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | `SessionIdentity` | yes | Workspace identity whose history and memory scope the suggestions. `identity.workspacePath` is required. |
| `maxItems` | number | no | Maximum number of suggestions requested. Defaults to `4`. The server may clamp overly large values. |

**Result**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `items` | `WelcomeSuggestionItem[]` | Suggested welcome actions for the current workspace. |
| `source` | string | Suggestion source kind. Initial values are `dynamic` and `none`. |
| `generatedAt` | string | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp describing when this result was generated. |
| `fingerprint` | string | Stable identifier for the returned evidence/result snapshot. Clients may use it to avoid redundant UI refresh. |

**`WelcomeSuggestionItem`**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Short label suitable for a welcome suggestion list. |
| `prompt` | string | Full prompt text to prefill into the input composer when the suggestion is chosen. |
| `reason` | string | Optional explanatory rationale intended for diagnostics, analytics, or non-primary UI surfaces. |

**Semantics**:

- Suggestions should be grounded in the current workspace rather than a global user profile.
- Suggestions should represent likely next tasks or follow-up asks, not a fixed taxonomy of product features.
- `source = "dynamic"` means the server returned workspace-specific personalized suggestions.
- `source = "none"` means the server intentionally did not return personalized suggestions for this call. Typical reasons include insufficient workspace evidence, a workspace-level preference disabling the feature, or transient generation unavailability.
- When `source = "none"`, `items` may be an empty list. Client-owned default suggestions remain out of band and are not serialized by this method.
- The server may inspect workspace-local memory through internal read-only mechanisms before generating suggestions, but those inspection steps are implementation-defined and not part of the wire contract.
- Servers may cache results for a short period and return the same `fingerprint` across repeated calls while the underlying workspace evidence has not materially changed.
- Servers SHOULD serve this method from a persisted workspace cache and SHOULD NOT trigger synchronous model generation from this request path. The persisted cache is a cross-process restart snapshot of the most recent successful dynamic result; it should not be deleted on normal client shutdown, and failed, canceled, or insufficient-context refresh attempts should leave the previous snapshot available.
- Cache refresh should run asynchronously after successful long-term memory consolidation. If the current memory evidence fingerprint already matches the persisted snapshot, the server may skip regeneration.

**Errors** (non-exhaustive): missing `identity.workspacePath`; unsupported capability; invalid `maxItems`; workspace not available.

## 6. Event Notifications

Event notifications are server-initiated messages (no `id`) that stream the turn lifecycle to the client. They correspond 1:1 to the `SessionEvent` types defined in the [Session Core Specification, Section 6](session-core.md#6-event-model).

All notifications share the pattern:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "<event-method>", "params": { ... } }
```

### 6.1 Thread Notifications

#### `thread/started`

Emitted when a new thread is created. Sent to the initiating client after `thread/start` (see Section 4.1), and **broadcast to connected clients** when a thread is created by any other channel in the same process. Session-backed SubAgent child thread creation is broadcast to the current connection too so sidebar/thread-list UIs can show the child immediately while the parent turn is still running.

**Params**: `{ "thread": Thread }`

#### `thread/renamed`

Emitted when a thread's **display name** changes. The server **broadcasts** this notification to **all** connected clients (same delivery model as `thread/started`). Typical triggers include successful `thread/rename` (Section 4.11) and automatic display-name assignment from turn input.

**Params**: `{ "threadId": "<id>", "displayName": "<non-empty string>" }`

Duplicate or idempotent deliveries for the same `threadId` and `displayName` are allowed.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "thread/renamed", "params": {
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
    "displayName": "Fix login bug"
} }
```

#### `thread/deleted`

Emitted when a thread is **permanently** deleted. The server **broadcasts** this notification to **all** connected clients after deletion completes, regardless of which protocol entry point or host integration triggered the removal.

**Params**: `{ "threadId": "<id>" }`

Duplicate notifications for the same `threadId` should be ignored.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "thread/deleted", "params": {
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4"
} }
```

#### `thread/resumed`

Emitted when a thread is resumed via `thread/resume`.

**Params**: `{ "thread": Thread, "resumedBy": "<channelName>" }`

#### `thread/statusChanged`

Emitted when a thread's status changes (Active → Paused, Active → Archived, etc.).

**Params**: `{ "threadId": "<id>", "previousStatus": "<status>", "newStatus": "<status>" }`

#### `thread/runtimeChanged`

Emitted when the server's aggregated **runtime snapshot** for a thread changes. This is a **workspace-level broadcast notification**: it is delivered to all initialized connections that have not opted out, regardless of whether they currently hold a `thread/subscribe` subscription for that thread.

This notification is a **summary channel** for sidebar or thread-list style UIs. It does **not** replace turn-scoped notifications such as `turn/started`, `turn/completed`, or `item/*`; those notifications continue to follow thread-subscription delivery rules. Clients that need full turn details must still subscribe to the target thread.

The server emits `thread/runtimeChanged` when any of the following state transitions changes the aggregated snapshot for a thread:

- a turn starts;
- a turn ends (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`);
- an approval request is created;
- an approval request is resolved;
- a turn finishes in plan mode with a successful terminal `CreatePlan` tool call, setting `waitingOnPlanConfirmation = true`;
- the next `turn/start` for that thread clears the pending plan confirmation state.

The server SHOULD broadcast this notification only when the effective snapshot actually changes. Duplicate deliveries are allowed; clients should treat the latest payload as authoritative and replace any prior cached snapshot for that `threadId`.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_20260420_x7k2m4",
  "runtime": {
    "running": true,
    "waitingOnApproval": false,
    "waitingOnPlanConfirmation": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Target thread id. |
| `runtime.running` | boolean | Whether a turn is currently executing for the thread. |
| `runtime.waitingOnApproval` | boolean | Whether the thread currently has one or more unresolved approval requests. |
| `runtime.waitingOnPlanConfirmation` | boolean | Whether the previous turn ended in plan mode with a successful terminal `CreatePlan` call and has not yet been cleared by the next `turn/start`. |

Forward-compatibility rule: future server versions may add additional boolean flags under `runtime` (for example `waitingOnUserInput`). Clients MUST ignore unknown fields.

### 6.2 Turn Notifications

#### `turn/started`

Emitted when a turn begins execution (after `turn/start` response).

**Params**: `{ "turn": Turn }`

The `turn` object includes the `UserMessage` input item.

#### `turn/completed`

Emitted when a turn finishes successfully.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "turn": {
    "id": "turn_001",
    "threadId": "thread_...",
    "status": "completed",
    "items": [ ... ],
    "startedAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:00Z",
    "completedAt": "2026-03-16T10:07:30Z",
    "tokenUsage": {
      "inputTokens": 1200,
      "outputTokens": 800,
      "totalTokens": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

#### `turn/failed`

Emitted when a turn fails due to an unrecoverable error.

**Params**: `{ "turn": Turn, "error": "<message>" }`

The `turn.status` is `"failed"` and `turn.error` contains the error description.

#### `turn/cancelled`

Emitted when a turn is cancelled via `turn/interrupt` or client disconnect.

**Params**: `{ "turn": Turn, "reason": "<description>" }`

#### `thread/queue/updated`

Emitted whenever a thread queue changes because input was enqueued, removed, dequeued, or restored after a failed dequeue start.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "queuedInputs": [
    {
      "id": "queued_...",
      "threadId": "thread_...",
      "displayText": "Run tests next",
      "status": "queued",
      "createdAt": "2026-04-25T10:00:00Z",
      "readyAfterTurnId": "turn_003"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6.3 Item Notifications

Items follow the lifecycle: `item/started` → zero or more `item/*/delta` → `item/completed`. See [Session Core, Section 5.3](session-core.md#53-item-lifecycle).

#### `item/started`

Emitted when a new item is created within a turn.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "item": {
    "id": "item_002",
    "turnId": "turn_001",
    "type": "toolCall",
    "status": "started",
    "payload": {
      "toolName": "Exec",
      "arguments": { "command": "npm test" },
      "callId": "call_001"
    },
    "createdAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:12Z"
  }
}
```

The canonical item payload schemas are defined in [Session Core, Section 4.2](session-core.md#42-item-payload-schemas). On the wire, clients should treat `item.type` as the discriminator and apply the following mapping rules:

| `item.type` | Wire-specific notes |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `userMessage` | Payload shape matches Session Core; property names are camelCase and nullable fields are omitted when absent. `text` is a compatibility/display field derived from the native input parts, not the sole source of truth. When present, `nativeInputParts` is authoritative for history rendering and `materializedInputParts` captures the exact snapshot sent to the model. Optional `deliveryMode` (`"normal"` / `"queued"` / `"guidance"`) lets clients distinguish direct input, queued input that later became a Turn, and active-Turn guidance. Optional `triggerKind` (`"heartbeat"` / `"cron"` / `"automation"` / `"goal"`), `triggerLabel`, and `triggerRefId` are emitted when the turn was synthesized by an automation mechanism (heartbeat, cron, Automations) or goal continuation rather than typed by a human; clients may use these to render a source affordance and route click-through when the source has a client surface. |
| `agentMessage` | Text deltas stream through `item/agentMessage/delta`; snapshots still use the canonical payload schema. |
| `reasoningContent` | Reasoning deltas stream through `item/reasoning/delta`; snapshots still use the canonical payload schema. |
| `toolCall` | Tool invocation payload uses camelCase fields such as `toolName`, `arguments`, and `callId`. When argument construction is streamed, clients receive `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` between `item/started` and `item/completed`. |
| `commandExecution` | Command execution payload uses camelCase fields such as `command`, `workingDirectory`, `source`, `status`, `aggregatedOutput`, `exitCode`, `durationMs`, and `callId`. |
| `toolExecution` | Runtime lifecycle enhancement for a normal tool invocation. Payload uses `callId`, `toolName`, `status`, `success`, `durationMs`, `resultPreview`, and `errorMessage`. It is emitted only when the client advertises `capabilities.toolExecutionLifecycle = true`. |
| `pluginFunctionCall` | Plugin function payload uses camelCase fields such as `pluginId`, `namespace`, `functionName`, `callId`, `arguments`, `contentItems`, `structuredResult`, `success`, `errorCode`, and `errorMessage`. For plugin-backed tools, including adapter-declared channel tools, this is the only conversation-item projection: the server emits `item/started` -> `item/completed` for `pluginFunctionCall` and does not emit companion `toolCall`/`toolResult` items. Plugin discovery and manifest architecture are defined in [plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md). |
| `dynamicToolCall` | Runtime dynamic tool payload uses camelCase fields such as `namespace`, `toolName`, `callId`, `arguments`, `contentItems`, `structuredResult`, `success`, `errorCode`, and `errorMessage`. Dynamic tools are thread-scoped AppServer client callbacks declared on `thread/start`; the server emits `item/started` -> `item/completed` for `dynamicToolCall` and does not emit companion `toolCall`/`toolResult` items. |
| `toolResult` | Result payload uses the canonical fields; transport serialization preserves nested JSON values losslessly. |
| `approvalRequest` | Approval payload uses the canonical fields plus wire enum/string serialization rules from this spec. |
| `approvalResponse` | Response payload uses the canonical fields; decision values are serialized as wire strings. |
| `error` | Error payload uses the canonical fields; transport-level JSON-RPC errors remain separate from item-level error items. |

#### `item/agentMessage/delta`

Streamed text delta for an `agentMessage` item. Concatenate `delta` values in order to reconstruct the full reply.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "itemId": "item_004",
  "deltaKind": "agentMessage",
  "delta": "Here is my analysis of the"
}
```

#### `item/reasoning/delta`

Streamed text delta for a `reasoningContent` item.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "itemId": "item_003",
  "deltaKind": "reasoningContent",
  "delta": "I need to check the test output first"
}
```

#### `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta`

Streamed arguments delta for a `toolCall` item. Concatenate `delta` values in order to build a progressive JSON-text preview of the tool arguments.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "itemId": "item_002",
  "deltaKind": "toolCallArguments",
  "toolName": "WriteFile",
  "callId": "call_001",
  "delta": "{\"path\":\"a.txt\",\"content\":\"hello"
}
```

`toolCall` items with streamed arguments follow this sequence:

1. `item/started` with `item.type = "toolCall"` (payload may contain partial metadata; `arguments` may be omitted or incomplete).
2. zero or more `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta`.
3. `item/completed` with the final `toolCall` payload, including complete `payload.arguments`.

Server coverage:

- Argument deltas are emitted for non-external tools by default, including built-in, module-contributed, and MCP tools. Individual tools can opt out via a server-side annotation, in which case clients only observe `item/started` followed by `item/completed` with no deltas.
- Plugin-backed tools do not emit `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` because they are projected as `pluginFunctionCall` items instead of `toolCall` items.
- Clients MUST NOT assume a specific built-in set has streaming enabled. Render UX based on the presence of `argumentsDelta` events for a given `toolCall` item.
- Clients are expected to render tool-specific UX only for tools they recognise; for unknown tool names (for example MCP tools), render a generic "generating parameters" placeholder without displaying the raw JSON to the user.

Client handling rules:

- `deltaKind` is fixed to `toolCallArguments`.
- `delta` is a raw JSON text fragment (not JSON Patch and not guaranteed to be parseable mid-stream).
- `toolName` and `callId` are typically present on the first chunk and may be omitted on subsequent chunks.
- Clients should merge chunks by `itemId` (or `callId` when useful) and append `delta` in arrival order for preview rendering.
- The authoritative executable/persisted arguments are the final `item/completed.item.payload.arguments`.
- Empty deltas are suppressed by the server and are not delivered.

#### `item/completed`

Emitted when an item is finalized. The `item.status` is `"completed"` and the payload contains the final accumulated value.

#### `item/commandExecution/outputDelta`

Streamed output delta for a `commandExecution` item. Concatenate `delta` values in order to reconstruct the live command output shown to the user.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_20260413_ab12cd",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "itemId": "item_004",
  "delta": "Downloading package 1 of 5...\n"
}
```

`commandExecution` items follow a fixed sequence:

1. `item/started` with `item.type = "commandExecution"` and payload `status = "inProgress"`
2. zero or more `item/commandExecution/outputDelta`
3. `item/completed` with final payload status and `aggregatedOutput`

Compatibility rule:

- When a connection advertises `capabilities.commandExecutionStreaming = true`, the server may emit the `commandExecution` projection for `Exec`-style tools so clients can render real-time shell output.
- The underlying `toolCall` / `toolResult` items still exist for model execution and persistence, but clients that support `commandExecution` should treat that item type as the primary terminal-output source to avoid duplicate rendering.
- A client may also use `commandExecution` as an enhancement source for an existing `Exec` tool card instead of rendering it as a standalone conversation item.
- Clients that do not advertise the capability continue to rely on existing `toolCall` / `toolResult` behavior.

#### `toolExecution` lifecycle

When a connection advertises `capabilities.toolExecutionLifecycle = true`, the server may emit a `toolExecution` item for each non-plugin tool invocation so clients can update one tool card as soon as that invocation finishes, even when other parallel tool calls are still running.

`toolExecution` items follow a fixed sequence:

1. `item/started` with `item.type = "toolExecution"` and payload `status = "inProgress"`.
2. `item/completed` with final payload `status`, `success`, `durationMs`, and optional `resultPreview` / `errorMessage`.

Payload shape:

```ts
{
  callId: string
  toolName: string
  status: "inProgress" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"
  success?: boolean
  durationMs?: number
  resultPreview?: string
  errorMessage?: string
}
```

Compatibility rule:

- `toolExecution` does not replace `toolCall` or `toolResult`. `toolCall` remains the model-request and final-arguments item; `toolResult` remains the complete, authoritative model-visible result.
- `resultPreview` is a UI preview only. It is sanitized text and may be truncated to 4096 characters. Clients should replace it with the matching `toolResult.result` when that result arrives.
- Plugin-backed tools do not emit companion `toolExecution`; their lifecycle is already represented by `pluginFunctionCall`.
- Runtime dynamic tools do not emit companion `toolExecution`; their lifecycle is represented by `dynamicToolCall`.
- Clients that do not advertise the capability continue to rely on existing `toolCall` / `toolResult` behavior.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "item": {
    "id": "item_004",
    "turnId": "turn_001",
    "type": "agentMessage",
    "status": "completed",
    "payload": {
      "text": "Here is my analysis of the test failures..."
    },
    "createdAt": "2026-03-16T10:05:30Z",
    "completedAt": "2026-03-16T10:06:15Z"
  }
}
```

### 6.4 Approval Notifications

#### `item/approval/resolved`

Emitted after the client responds to an approval request and the server processes the decision. This is distinct from `item/completed` for the `approvalResponse` item — `item/approval/resolved` is emitted first, then the regular `item/completed` follows.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "item": {
    "id": "item_006",
    "type": "approvalResponse",
    "status": "completed",
    "payload": {
      "requestId": "approval_001",
      "approved": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.5 SubAgent Notifications

#### `subagent/progress`

Emitted periodically (~200ms) when one or more SubAgent tool calls (`SpawnAgent`) are active during a Turn. Each notification carries a **complete snapshot** of all tracked SubAgents' progress, allowing clients to replace their local state on each receipt.

This notification is a sideband signal — it may interleave with `item/*` and `turn/*` notifications.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "entries": [
    {
      "label": "code-explorer",
      "currentTool": "ReadFile",
      "inputTokens": 4500,
      "outputTokens": 1200,
      "isCompleted": false
    },
    {
      "label": "test-runner",
      "currentTool": null,
      "inputTokens": 2000,
      "outputTokens": 600,
      "isCompleted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Parent thread. |
| `turnId` | string | Active turn. |
| `entries` | SubAgentEntry[] | Snapshot of all tracked SubAgents. |

`SubAgentEntry` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `label` | string | SubAgent identifier/label (matches the `agentNickname` argument passed to `SpawnAgent`). |
| `currentTool` | string? | Name of the tool the SubAgent is currently executing. `null` when the SubAgent is thinking (waiting for model response). |
| `inputTokens` | integer | Cumulative input token consumption. |
| `outputTokens` | integer | Cumulative output token consumption. |
| `isCompleted` | boolean | Whether the SubAgent has finished execution. |

**Emission rules**:

- The server emits this notification at ~200ms intervals while SubAgents are active. The exact interval is an implementation detail and may vary.
- Each notification contains the **complete set** of tracked SubAgents for the current Turn — not incremental deltas.
- The server stops emitting once all tracked SubAgents have completed and a final snapshot with all `isCompleted = true` has been sent.
- Clients that do not need SubAgent progress can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["subagent/progress"]` during `initialize`.

#### `subagent/graphChanged`

Emitted when a session-backed SubAgent parent/child edge is created or changes status. Clients should refresh `subagent/children/list` for the parent and may use returned `thread` summaries to hydrate thread lists/sidebar entries immediately.

**Params**: `{ "parentThreadId": "<parent>", "childThreadId": "<child>" }`

**Example sequence**:

```
Server                                          Client
  |                                               |

  |  item: { type: "toolCall",                    |

  |    arguments: { agentPrompt: "inspect code",  |
  |      agentNickname: "code-explorer" } }        |

### 6.6 Usage Notifications

#### `item/usage/delta`

Emitted each time the agent completes an LLM iteration and produces a `UsageContent` with non-zero token counts. Carries the **incremental** token consumption for that single iteration.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "inputTokens": 1200,
  "outputTokens": 350,
  "cachedInputTokens": 0,
  "cacheWriteInputTokens": 0,
  "freshInputTokens": 1200,
  "reasoningOutputTokens": 0,
  "llmCallDelta": 1,
  "contextInputTokens": 14820,
  "turnInputTokens": 1200,
  "turnOutputTokens": 350,
  "turnLlmCalls": 1,
  "totalInputTokens": 14820,
  "totalOutputTokens": 2610,
  "contextUsage": {
    "tokens": 14820,
    "contextWindow": 200000,
    "autoCompactThreshold": 180000,
    "warningThreshold": 176000,
    "errorThreshold": 194000,
    "percentLeft": 0.9259
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Parent thread. |
| `turnId` | string | Active turn. |
| `inputTokens` | integer | Input tokens consumed in this LLM iteration (delta, not cumulative). |
| `outputTokens` | integer | Output tokens consumed in this LLM iteration (delta, not cumulative). |
| `cachedInputTokens` | integer | Cache-hit/cache-read input tokens consumed in this LLM iteration (delta, not cumulative). |
| `cacheWriteInputTokens` | integer | Cache-creation/cache-write input tokens consumed in this LLM iteration (delta, not cumulative). |
| `freshInputTokens` | integer | Derived fresh input delta: `max(0, inputTokens - cachedInputTokens - cacheWriteInputTokens)`. |
| `reasoningOutputTokens` | integer | Reasoning output tokens consumed in this LLM iteration (delta, not cumulative). |
| `llmCallDelta` | integer | Optional. `1` when this delta starts a new LLM request, otherwise `0`. |
| `contextInputTokens` | integer | Optional. Persisted context-occupancy input-token snapshot for the thread. Drives the desktop context-usage ring without waiting for turn completion. It is not billing/cumulative thread usage. |
| `totalInputTokens` | integer | Optional. Backward-compatible alias of `contextInputTokens`; not billing/cumulative thread usage. |
| `turnInputTokens` | integer | Optional. Cumulative billing input tokens emitted so far in the current turn. |
| `totalOutputTokens` | integer | Optional. Backward-compatible cumulative output tokens emitted so far in the current turn. |
| `turnOutputTokens` | integer | Optional. Cumulative billing output tokens emitted so far in the current turn. |
| `turnLlmCalls` | integer | Optional. Cumulative LLM request count emitted so far in the current turn. |
| `contextUsage` | object | Optional. Full `ContextUsageSnapshot` matching `totalInputTokens`, including thresholds needed to seed the desktop token ring. |

**Emission rules**:

- Emitted once per LLM iteration, immediately after the provider's `UsageContent` is processed.
- Each notification carries only the delta for the current LLM request. Providers may emit cumulative usage snapshots within one request; Session Core normalizes those snapshots before emitting.
- The sum of all `item/usage/delta` notifications for a Turn's main agent equals the main-agent billing portion of `turn/completed.tokenUsage`.
- Context-window occupancy is separate: `contextInputTokens`/`totalInputTokens` is the latest main-agent request input snapshot, not the billing sum.
- Example: if one Turn has request input snapshots `12000 | 20000 | 41000`, `turnInputTokens` reaches `73000`, while `contextInputTokens` remains `41000`.
- Cache-hit accounting is cumulative by the same rule: `cachedInputTokens` deltas sum to the Turn's cache-hit input total, so dashboards can show how much of `turnInputTokens` came from cache hits.
- SubAgent tokens are reported separately via `subagent/progress` and are not included in `item/usage/delta`.
- Clients that do not need real-time token display can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["item/usage/delta"]` during `initialize`.

**Example sequence**:

```
Server                                          Client
  |                                               |
  | item/usage/delta (notification)               |
  |  inputTokens: 1200, outputTokens: 350         |

  |                                               |
  | turn/completed (notification)                 |
  |  tokenUsage: { inputTokens: 3300,             |
  |    cachedInputTokens: 0, cacheWriteInputTokens: 0, |
  |    outputTokens: 830, totalTokens: 4130 }     |
  |<----------------------------------------------|
```

### 6.7 System Notifications

#### `system/event`

Emitted when a system-level maintenance operation occurs during a Turn's post-processing phase. These operations (context compaction, memory consolidation) are not part of the agent's conversational output but affect the session's internal state.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_...",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "kind": "compactWarning",
  "message": "Context nearing capacity",
  "percentLeft": 0.12,
  "tokenCount": 176000
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Parent thread. |
| `turnId` | string? | Active turn. May be null for asynchronous thread-scoped maintenance events such as `consolidated`, `consolidationSkipped`, and `consolidationFailed`. |
| `kind` | string | Event kind. One of: `"compactWarning"`, `"compactError"`, `"compacting"`, `"compacted"`, `"compactSkipped"`, `"compactFailed"`, `"consolidating"`, `"consolidated"`, `"consolidationSkipped"`, `"consolidationFailed"`. |
| `message` | string? | Human-readable description (or machine-readable reason on `compactSkipped` / `compactFailed` / `consolidationSkipped` / `consolidationFailed`). May be null. |
| `percentLeft` | number? | Fraction of the effective context window still unused (`0.0`-`1.0`). Populated for compaction-related events. |
| `tokenCount` | number? | Current estimated prompt token usage. Populated for compaction-related events. |

**Defined `kind` values**:

| Kind | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `compactWarning` | Token usage crossed the warning threshold but not the error threshold. Advisory only. |
| `compactError` | Token usage crossed the error threshold; auto-compaction is imminent. Advisory only. |
| `compacting` | A compaction attempt (auto or reactive) is starting. |
| `compacted` | Compaction completed successfully. Token tracker has been reset. |
| `compactSkipped` | Compaction was evaluated but not executed (below threshold, nothing new to summarize, or circuit breaker tripped). |
| `compactFailed` | Compaction attempted but failed (LLM error, cancellation). Repeated failures trip the circuit breaker. |
| `consolidating` | Memory consolidation is starting (fire-and-forget, driven by Session Core after a configured number of successful Turns). |
| `consolidated` | Memory consolidation completed successfully. MEMORY.md / HISTORY.md have been updated. |
| `consolidationSkipped` | Memory consolidation completed without writing MEMORY.md or HISTORY.md (for example, the model did not call `save_memory` or produced no valid changes). Clients should dismiss any active consolidation status and should not show a success marker. |
| `consolidationFailed` | Memory consolidation failed. Clients should dismiss any active consolidation status and may surface `message`. |

**Emission rules**:

- System events are emitted during the Turn's post-processing phase, before `turn/completed`.
- Threshold advisory events (`compactWarning`, `compactError`) fire when token usage crosses a threshold but auto-compaction has not yet been triggered.
- Auto-compaction is a synchronous pair: `compacting` → one of `compacted` / `compactSkipped` / `compactFailed`.
- Reactive compaction fires on the Turn's error path when the model rejects a request with `prompt_too_long` / `context_length_exceeded`. The Turn still fails, but `compacting` and its terminal event are emitted first so UIs know the history was repaired before the user retries.
- Memory consolidation is fire-and-forget after a configured number of successful Turns; it is independent from compaction and the Turn completes without awaiting it. The start event is `consolidating`; the terminal event is one of `consolidated`, `consolidationSkipped`, or `consolidationFailed`. See [Memory Consolidation](memory-consolidation.md) for the design contract.
- Clients that do not need system maintenance status can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["system/event"]` during `initialize`.
- On a successful `compacted` event (auto or reactive trigger), Session Core additionally persists a `SystemNotice` SessionItem (kind = `"compacted"`) into the current turn and emits the normal `item/started` + `item/completed` pair for it. This gives clients a persistent timeline marker that survives thread reload, alongside the transient `system/event` notification used to drive toast/status-line UX. See [Session Core](session-core.md#systemnotice) for the payload schema.
- On a successful `consolidated` event, Session Core additionally persists a `SystemNotice` SessionItem (kind = `"memoryConsolidated"`) into the completed turn and emits the normal `item/started` + `item/completed` pair through the thread event broker. `consolidationSkipped` does not create a persistent notice.

**Example sequence**:

```
Server                                          Client
  |                                               |

  |  kind: "compacting",                          |

  |  turn: { ... }                                |
  |<----------------------------------------------|
```

### 6.8 Plan Notifications

#### `plan/updated`

Emitted when the agent creates or updates a structured plan via plan-management tools. The notification carries the complete plan snapshot.

This notification is independent of the Turn event stream. Clients that do not need plan progress display can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["plan/updated"]` during `initialize`.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "title": "Implement user authentication",
  "overview": "Add JWT-based auth with login and registration endpoints",
  "content": "## Scope\n\nImplement backend auth endpoints and middleware.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Add User model\n2. Add login/register APIs\n3. Add JWT middleware",
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "setup-models",
      "content": "Create User model and migration",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "completed"
    },
    {
      "id": "auth-endpoints",
      "content": "Implement login and register API endpoints",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "in_progress"
    },
    {
      "id": "jwt-middleware",
      "content": "Add JWT validation middleware",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Plan title. |
| `overview` | string | Brief plan overview/description. May be empty. |
| `content` | string | Full Markdown plan body. May be empty. |
| `todos` | PlanTodo[] | Complete list of plan tasks. |

`PlanTodo` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Short kebab-case task identifier. |
| `content` | string | Human-readable task description. |
| `priority` | string | One of: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`. |
| `status` | string | One of: `"pending"`, `"in_progress"`, `"completed"`, `"cancelled"`. |

Compatibility note: older servers may omit `content`; clients should treat missing `content` as an empty string.

**Emission rules**:

- Emitted each time any plan tool (`CreatePlan`, `UpdateTodos`, `TodoWrite`) completes successfully.
- Each notification carries the **complete plan snapshot** — not incremental deltas. Clients should replace their local plan state on each receipt.
- The notification is sent outside the `SessionEvent` stream; it is a direct JSON-RPC notification from the host to all connected transports.
- Clients that do not need plan progress can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["plan/updated"]` during `initialize`.

---

## 7. Approval Flow

When the agent encounters a sensitive operation (file write, shell command) that requires user consent, the server initiates a bidirectional approval exchange. This is a **server-to-client request** — the server sends a JSON-RPC request with an `id`, and the client must respond.

### 7.1 Sequence

```
Server                              Client
  |                                   |
  | item/started (notification)       |
  |   type: "approvalRequest"         |
  |---------------------------------->|
  |                                   |
  | item/approval/request (request)   |
  |   id: <server-assigned>           |
  |---------------------------------->|
  |                                   |
  |   (client shows approval UI)      |
  |                                   |
  | response (id: <same>)             |
  |   result: { decision: "..." }     |
  |<----------------------------------|
  |                                   |
  | item/approval/resolved (notify)   |
  |---------------------------------->|
  |                                   |
  | item/completed (notification)     |
  |   (for the tool call item)        |
  |---------------------------------->|
```

The turn enters `"waitingApproval"` status while the server waits for the client's response.

### 7.2 `item/approval/request`

**Direction**: server → client (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Parent thread. |
| `turnId` | string | Active turn. |
| `itemId` | string | The `approvalRequest` item ID. |
| `requestId` | string | Unique correlation ID for this approval. |
| `approvalType` | string | `"shell"` or `"file"`. |
| `operation` | string | For shell: the command. For file: `"read"`, `"write"`, `"edit"`, `"list"`. |
| `target` | string | For shell: working directory. For file: the file path. |
| `scopeKey` | string | Session-scoped cache key used when the client returns `acceptForSession`. |
| `reason` | string | Human-readable explanation of why approval is needed. |

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "item/approval/request", "id": 100, "params": {
    "threadId": "thread_20260316_x7k2m4",
    "turnId": "turn_001",
    "itemId": "item_005",
    "requestId": "approval_001",
    "approvalType": "shell",
    "operation": "npm test",
    "target": "/home/dev/myproject",
    "scopeKey": "shell:*",
    "reason": "Agent wants to execute a shell command"
} }
```

### 7.3 Client Response

The client responds with the standard JSON-RPC response format:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 100, "result": {
    "decision": "accept"
} }
```

**Decision values**:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `"accept"` | Approve this single operation. |
| `"acceptForSession"` | Approve this operation and similar operations for the remainder of the thread's lifetime. |
| `"acceptAlways"` | Approve this operation permanently. The server persists the approval so future sessions do not prompt again. Also suppresses further prompts for the current session. |
| `"decline"` | Reject the operation. The agent receives a rejection signal and may try an alternative approach. |
| `"cancel"` | Reject and cancel the entire turn. Equivalent to `turn/interrupt`. |

When approval resolution is persisted or echoed back in a later event, the response item carries both:

- `approved`: boolean convenience field for legacy consumers.
- `decision`: the exact rich decision value chosen by the user.

### 7.4 Clients Without Approval Support

If a client declared `capabilities.approvalSupport = false` during initialization, the server must not send `item/approval/request`. Instead, the server resolves approvals non-interactively using the same server-owned thread policy model:

- `approvalPolicy = autoApprove` resolves as `accept`.
- `approvalPolicy = interrupt` resolves as `cancel`.
- `approvalPolicy = default` first resolves through the workspace default approval policy. If both the thread policy and workspace default are `default` or unset, the server cannot prompt on a non-interactive client, so it falls back to its non-interactive default decision. In the current implementation and spec baseline, that fallback is `decline`.

The same non-interactive fallback may also be applied when an approval-capable client disconnects, the approval request cannot be written to the transport, or the client times out before replying.

---

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 JSON-RPC Error Response

Errors follow the standard JSON-RPC 2.0 error response format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 10,
  "error": {
    "code": -32600,
    "message": "Invalid request",
    "data": { "detail": "Thread not found: thread_invalid" }
  }
}
```

### 8.2 Standard Error Codes

| Code | Name | When |
|------|------|------|
| `-32700` | Parse error | Malformed JSON. |
| `-32600` | Invalid request | Missing required fields, invalid params, or constraint violation. |
| `-32601` | Method not found | Unknown method name. |
| `-32602` | Invalid params | Params present but do not match the expected schema. |
| `-32603` | Internal error | Unexpected server failure. |

### 8.3 DotCraft-Specific Error Codes

| Code | Name | When |
|------|------|------|
| `-32001` | Server overloaded | Backpressure: too many in-flight requests. Retryable. |
| `-32002` | Not initialized | Method called before `initialize` handshake. |
| `-32003` | Already initialized | `initialize` called more than once on the same connection. |
| `-32010` | Thread not found | The specified `threadId` does not exist. |
| `-32011` | Thread not active | Operation requires an active thread but the thread is paused or archived. |
| `-32012` | Turn in progress | A turn is already running or waiting for approval on this thread. |
| `-32013` | Turn not found | The specified `turnId` does not exist on the thread. |
| `-32014` | Turn not running | `turn/interrupt` called on a turn that is not in progress. |
| `-32020` | Approval timeout | The client took too long to respond to an approval request. |
| `-32030` | Channel rejected | The channel adapter name is not registered in server configuration. |
| `-32031` | Cron job not found | The specified cron job ID does not exist. |
| `-32040` | Skill not found | The requested skill name does not exist in any source (workspace, user, or builtin). |
| `-32051` | Task not found | `automation/*`: the specified task does not exist. |
| `-32052` | Task invalid status | `automation/*`: the operation is not valid for the task’s current status. |
| `-32054` | Task already exists | `automation/task/create`: a task with the same ID already exists. |
| `-32055` | Thread binding invalid | `automation/task/updateBinding` / `automation/task/create`: the target `threadId` does not exist or is archived. |

Automation task methods are defined in full in [automations-lifecycle.md §13](automations-lifecycle.md). Summary of the v1 wire surface:

- `automation/task/list`, `automation/task/read`, `automation/task/create`, `automation/task/updateBinding`, `automation/task/delete` — CRUD and binding updates for local automation tasks. Task-level review and cancel endpoints are not part of this surface.
- `automation/task/updateBinding` `{ taskId, threadBinding?: { threadId, mode } | null }` → `{ task }` — rewrites only the `thread_binding` block on disk; pass `null` to unbind.
- `automation/template/list` `{}` → `{ templates: AutomationTemplateWire[] }` — returns the built-in local task templates followed by any user-authored templates so desktop clients can render the "Use template" picker without bundling a copy. User templates carry `isUser: true`; built-ins omit the field (default `false`). User templates also populate `createdAt` / `updatedAt` (ISO-8601 UTC).
- `automation/template/save` `{ id?, title, description?, icon?, category?, workflowMarkdown, defaultSchedule?, defaultWorkspaceMode?, defaultApprovalPolicy?, needsThreadBinding, defaultTitle?, defaultDescription? }` → `{ template: AutomationTemplateWire }` — upsert a user template. When `id` is omitted the server assigns `"user-" + shortGuid`. Rejects built-in id collisions, path-traversal / invalid id shapes (`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,63}$`), empty `title` / `workflowMarkdown`, and overlong `title` (>200 chars).
- `automation/template/delete` `{ id }` → `{ ok: true }` — delete a user template directory. Built-in ids and invalid id shapes are rejected with `-32602` Invalid params. Idempotent: missing directories return `{ ok: true }`.
- User template disk layout: `<CraftPath>/automations/templates/<id>/template.md` (overridable via `Automations.UserTemplatesRoot`). The file is YAML front matter (`id`, `title`, `description`, `icon`, `category`, `default_schedule`, `default_workspace_mode`, `default_approval_policy`, `needs_thread_binding`, `default_title`, `default_description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) followed by the complete `workflow.md` body that is copied into new tasks applying the template.
- `AutomationTaskWire.status` is one of `pending`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed`, and carries optional `schedule` (mirrors `CronSchedule`), `threadBinding` (`{ threadId, mode: "run-in-thread" }`), and `nextRunAt` (ISO-8601 UTC).
- `automation/task/create` accepts `schedule`, `threadBinding`, and `templateId` in addition to the existing fields. When both `templateId` and explicit fields are supplied, the explicit fields win.

### 8.4 Turn-Level Errors

Errors during agent execution are delivered as `turn/failed` notifications (not as JSON-RPC error responses to the `turn/start` request, because the request itself succeeded — it is the asynchronous agent run that failed).

The `turn/failed` notification includes the error in `turn.error`:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "turn/failed", "params": {
    "turn": {
      "id": "turn_001",
      "threadId": "thread_...",
      "status": "failed",
      "error": "Model returned an error: context window exceeded"
    }
} }
```

If an `Error` item was created during the turn, it appears in the `items` array and is also emitted via `item/started` / `item/completed` before the `turn/failed` notification.

---

## 9. Backpressure

### 9.1 Server-Side Queuing

The server uses bounded internal queues between transport ingress, request processing, and outbound writes. When the inbound queue is saturated:

- New requests are rejected with error code `-32001` and message `"Server overloaded; retry later."`.
- Clients should treat this as retryable and use **exponential backoff with jitter**.

### 9.2 Client-Side Considerations

- Clients should not send a `turn/start` while a turn is already in progress on the same thread. The server rejects this with error code `-32012`.
- Clients should consume notifications promptly. If a client falls behind on reading stdout (stdio transport) or WebSocket frames, the server may buffer up to a limit and then drop the connection.

### 6.9 Job Result Notifications

#### `system/jobResult`

Emitted after a server-managed cron or heartbeat job completes. This allows connected wire clients to receive the agent's response as an out-of-band notification, without the client initiating a turn.

Clients can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["system/jobResult"]` during `initialize`.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "source": "cron",
  "jobId": "9c933b01",
  "jobName": "喝水提醒",
  "threadId": "thread_abc123",
  "result": "提醒：该喝水了！保持水分对健康很重要。",
  "error": null,
  "tokenUsage": { "inputTokens": 420, "outputTokens": 38 }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | string | `"cron"` or `"heartbeat"`. |
| `jobId` | string? | Cron job ID. Present when `source` is `"cron"`; absent for heartbeat. |
| `jobName` | string? | Human-readable job name. |
| `threadId` | string? | The thread ID used for execution. |
| `result` | string? | Agent's text response. Null if the turn failed or produced no text output. |
| `error` | string? | Error message if the turn failed. |
| `tokenUsage` | object? | `{ inputTokens, outputTokens }`. |

**Targeting rules**:

- Emitted to initialized protocol connections that are eligible to receive job-result notifications.
- Server hosts that route job results through another delivery surface may omit `system/jobResult`.
- Clients that do not wish to receive cron/heartbeat results can opt out via `optOutNotificationMethods: ["system/jobResult"]`.

**Behavior notes**:

- The `result` field carries the agent's full text output from the completed run.
- The `threadId` field may be used with `thread/read` to retrieve the associated conversation history.
- `cron/stateChanged` may also be emitted for the same completion when the source is a cron job.

**Example sequence**:

```
Server                                         Client
  |                                               |
  | (60 s after job was scheduled)                |
  |                                               |
  | [CronService timer fires, AgentRunner runs]   |
  |                                               |
  | system/jobResult (notification)               |
  |  source: "cron",                              |
  |  jobId: "9c933b01",                           |
  |  jobName: "喝水提醒",                         |
  |  threadId: "thread_abc123",                   |
  |  result: "该喝水了！保持水分对健康很重要。"   |
  |  tokenUsage: { inputTokens: 420, ... }        |
  |<----------------------------------------------|
  |                                               |
  | cron/stateChanged (notification)              |
  |  job.state.lastThreadId: "thread_abc123",     |
  |  job.state.lastResult: "该喝水了！...",       |
  |  removed: false                               |
  |<----------------------------------------------|
```

### 6.10 Notification Delivery Guarantees

The server MUST deliver each event notification **at most once per connection**, regardless of how many delivery paths are active for that thread.

**At-most-once rule**: When a connection holds an active `thread/subscribe` subscription for a thread and calls `turn/start` on the same thread, the server MUST NOT create a separate inline notification dispatch path for the turn. The existing subscription dispatcher is the sole delivery path for all turn-scoped notifications. The `turn/start` JSON-RPC response is still returned inline before any notifications are emitted.

This rule applies to all turn-scoped notifications:

| Notification | Covered |
|---|---|
| `turn/started` | yes |
| `turn/completed` | yes |
| `turn/failed` | yes |
| `turn/cancelled` | yes |
| `item/started` | yes |
| `item/agentMessage/delta` | yes |
| `item/reasoning/delta` | yes |
| `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` | yes |
| `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` | yes |
| `item/completed` | yes |
| `item/usage/delta` | yes |
| `subagent/progress` | yes |
| `system/event` | yes |

Broadcast summary notifications such as `thread/started`, `thread/renamed`, `thread/deleted`, `thread/statusChanged`, and `thread/runtimeChanged` are **not** part of this thread-subscription delivery rule. They remain workspace-level broadcasts and may be delivered even when the connection is not subscribed to the target thread.

**Rationale**: Without this rule, a connection that both subscribes to a thread and starts a turn on that thread could receive duplicate notifications through multiple delivery paths.

**Ordering guarantee**: The at-most-once rule does not relax the ordering guarantee. The `turn/start` response still arrives before the first `turn/started` notification.

**Best-effort delivery**: Notifications are best-effort per connection. A transport write failure must stop further writes to that client, but it must not stop the server from draining an already-started persisted turn's event stream. Passive `thread/subscribe` streams remain tied to the connection and are cancelled when that connection closes; active turn execution continues independently. When `turn/start` uses the subscription path, the server's internal active-turn drain must continue after subscription cancellation and resolve disconnected approvals through the same non-interactive fallback described in [Section 7.4](#74-clients-without-approval-support). Reconnected clients recover state through `thread/read`, `thread/list`, and fresh subscriptions.

---

## 10. Notification Opt-Out

Clients can suppress specific notification methods per connection by listing exact method names in `initialize.params.capabilities.optOutNotificationMethods`.

- Matching is **exact** — no wildcards or prefix matching.
- Unknown method names are accepted and silently ignored.
- Applies only to server-to-client notifications, not to requests or responses.
- Opt-out is negotiated once at initialization time and cannot be changed for the connection's lifetime.

**Common opt-out targets**:

| Method | When to opt out |
|--------|-----------------|
| `item/agentMessage/delta` | Client does not support streaming; will wait for `item/completed`. |
| `item/reasoning/delta` | Client does not display reasoning content. |
| `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` | Client does not need progressive tool-argument preview; waits for final `item/completed` payload. |
| `thread/started` | Client does not need thread lifecycle events. |
| `thread/renamed` | Client does not need server-pushed display name updates (e.g. refreshes `thread/list` on a timer only). |
| `thread/deleted` | Client does not need thread list sync when threads are removed elsewhere (e.g. polls `thread/list` only). |
| `thread/statusChanged` | Client manages thread status locally. |
| `thread/runtimeChanged` | Client does not display per-thread live activity indicators (e.g. batch runner, headless integration). |
| `subagent/progress` | Client does not display SubAgent real-time progress. |
| `item/usage/delta` | Client does not need real-time token consumption display; will use `turn/completed.tokenUsage` for final totals. |
| `system/event` | Client does not need system maintenance status (compaction, consolidation). |
| `plan/updated` | Client does not need real-time plan/todo progress display. |
| `system/jobResult` | Client does not need cron/heartbeat result notifications (e.g. batch or headless client). |
| `cron/stateChanged` | Client polls `cron/list` instead of reacting to server-push job state updates. |

**Example**:

```json
{
  "clientInfo": { "name": "batch-runner", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "capabilities": {
    "streamingSupport": false,
    "optOutNotificationMethods": [
      "item/agentMessage/delta",
      "item/reasoning/delta",
      "item/toolCall/argumentsDelta"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 11. Extension Methods

The core wire protocol (Sections 3–10) covers the `ISessionService` surface. Modules may expose **extension methods** for capabilities that are not intrinsic to the session core.

### 11.1 Design Rules

- Core methods are owned by the AppServer protocol runtime. Module methods are contributed by loaded modules and routed by method name at runtime.
- Module methods must not reuse a Core method name. If a module method is unavailable because the contributing module is not loaded or cannot operate in the current workspace, the server returns `-32601` (`Method not found`).
- Server-to-client extension families continue to use the `ext/<namespace>/...` prefix (for example `ext/acp/...`).
- Client-to-server module methods may use stable product namespaces; they are standard protocol extensions even when implemented by a module instead of Core.
- `initialize` may advertise extension availability in `capabilities.extensions`. Compatibility top-level capability fields may coexist during migration.
- Clients must treat the spec as the source of truth for a documented extension's method names and payloads; implementation location inside the server is not wire-visible.

### 11.2 Unified Channel Runtime (Remote Projection)

The external channel adapter integration uses **server → client** JSON-RPC requests under the `ext/channel/*` namespace. These methods are bidirectional protocol extensions in the same sense as `item/approval/request`: the server sends a request with an `id`, and the adapter returns a structured `result`.

Capability negotiation happens during `initialize` via `capabilities.channelAdapter`:

- `deliveryCapabilities.structuredDelivery = true` means the adapter implements the unified delivery contract through `ext/channel/send`.
- media entries under `deliveryCapabilities.media` describe which `message.kind` values the remote backend accepts and which source forms are allowed.
- `channelTools` declares the channel-scoped tools that may be injected into matching-origin threads for the lifetime of the connection.
- adapter-declared tools are validated and registered once per connection; later thread-level tool construction only filters visibility for the matching origin channel and current reserved names.

#### 11.2.1 `ext/channel/send`

Structured delivery path for text and media payloads.

**Direction**: server → client (request, requires response)

**Params**:

```json
{
  "target": "group:12345",
  "message": {
    "kind": "file",
    "caption": "Latest report",
    "fileName": "report.pdf",
    "mediaType": "application/pdf",
    "source": {
      "kind": "artifactId",
      "artifactId": "artifact_001"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "origin": "cron"
  }
}
```

`message.kind` values standardized in v1:

- `text`
- `file`
- `audio`
- `image`
- `video`

`message` fields:

- `kind: string`
- `text?: string`
- `caption?: string`
- `fileName?: string`
- `mediaType?: string`
- `source?: ChannelMediaSource`

`ChannelMediaSource` fields:

- `kind: "hostPath" | "url" | "dataBase64" | "artifactId"`
- `hostPath?: string`
- `url?: string`
- `dataBase64?: string`
- `artifactId?: string`

Adapters must treat `source.kind` as authoritative and ignore unrelated source fields.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "delivered": true,
  "remoteMessageId": "msg_123",
  "remoteMediaId": "media_456",
  "errorCode": null,
  "errorMessage": null
}
```

When `delivered` is `false`, `errorCode` should use a stable string when possible. Standard protocol-level values:

- `UnsupportedDeliveryKind`
- `UnsupportedMediaSource`
- `MediaTooLarge`
- `MediaTypeNotAllowed`
- `MediaArtifactNotFound`
- `MediaResolutionFailed`
- `AdapterDeliveryFailed`
- `AdapterProtocolViolation`

#### 11.2.3 `ext/channel/toolCall`

Structured runtime tool invocation for adapter-declared channel tools.

**Direction**: server → client (request, requires response)

**Params**:

```json
{
  "threadId": "thread_001",
  "turnId": "turn_002",
  "callId": "exttool_001",
  "tool": "TelegramSendDocumentToCurrentChat",
  "arguments": {
    "fileName": "report.pdf"
  },
  "context": {
    "channelName": "telegram",
    "channelContext": "-1001234567890",
    "senderId": "user_42",
    "groupId": "-1001234567890"
  }
}
```

**Result**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "contentItems": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Sent report.pdf to the current chat." }
  ],
  "structuredResult": {
    "delivered": true,
    "fileName": "report.pdf"
  }
}
```

### 11.3 `item/tool/call`

Runtime dynamic tool invocation for client-declared `thread/start.dynamicTools`.

**Direction**: server -> client (request, requires response)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | Thread in which the tool is being executed. |
| `turnId` | string | Turn that owns the tool call. |
| `callId` | string | Server-generated tool call identifier. |
| `namespace` | string? | Optional namespace from the dynamic tool spec. |
| `tool` | string | Declared dynamic tool name. |
| `arguments` | object | Validated tool arguments matching `inputSchema`. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "contentItems": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Review draft recorded." }
  ],
  "structuredResult": {
    "draftId": "draft_123"
  }
}
```

If the tool fails, the client returns `{ "success": false, "errorCode": "...", "errorMessage": "..." }`. If the client disconnects, times out, or returns an invalid result, DotCraft completes the `dynamicToolCall` item as failed.

When `success` is `false`, `errorCode` should use a stable string when possible. Standard protocol-level values:

- `UnsupportedTool`
- `MissingChatContext`
- `InvalidArguments`
- `AdapterToolCallFailed`
- `AdapterProtocolViolation`
- `ExternalChannelToolTimeout`

Behavior rules:

- The server must only call tools declared in `capabilities.channelAdapter.channelTools` during `initialize`.
- A connected adapter's declared tool set is immutable for the lifetime of that connection.
- If an adapter declares channel tools, it must handle `ext/channel/toolCall` requests for those tools.
- Tool registration comes from the adapter's runtime handshake, not from static `ExternalChannels` config.
- When a tool descriptor declares `approval`, the server may gate execution before sending `ext/channel/toolCall`.
- `approval` metadata identifies approval targets for server interception only; it does not define an adapter-local approval policy.
- Any gating decision for adapter-declared tools must be resolved from the same server-owned thread/workspace policy surfaces used by built-in tools.
- For adapter-declared tools, item lifecycle projection is `pluginFunctionCall` only (`item/started` → `item/completed`). The server does not emit companion `toolCall`, `toolResult`, or `item/toolCall/argumentsDelta` events for the same invocation.

### 11.3 ACP Tool Proxy

The ACP (Agent Client Protocol) integration allows the agent's tools to access the IDE client's filesystem, terminals, and custom extension methods. On the AppServer wire, these map to **server → client** JSON-RPC requests (same bidirectional pattern as `item/approval/request` in [Section 7](#7-approval-flow)): the server sends a request with a numeric `id`; the client responds with a `result` or `error`.

**Capability negotiation**: The client declares `capabilities.acpExtensions` during `initialize` (see [Section 3.2](#32-initialize)). The server must only send `ext/acp/*` requests that the client has advertised:

- `fsReadTextFile` → may send `ext/acp/fs/readTextFile`
- `fsWriteTextFile` → may send `ext/acp/fs/writeTextFile`
- `terminalCreate` → may send `ext/acp/terminal/*`
- Each entry in `extensions` (e.g. `"_unity"`) → may send `ext/acp/<family>/<method>` for that family

**Per-thread binding**: When a connection that declared `acpExtensions` successfully creates a thread via `thread/start`, the server binds that thread id to that connection. While the agent runs a turn on that thread, `ext/acp/*` calls from tools are routed to the **bound** client's transport. If that connection closes before a pending `ext/acp/*` completes, the request fails (timeout or connection error).

**`threadId` in server→client params**: Every server→client `ext/acp/*` request MUST include `threadId` (string, camelCase) in `params`, equal to the Session Wire thread id for that turn. This lets clients with a single Wire connection (e.g. an ACP bridge) route concurrent server-initiated requests to the correct IDE session. Method-specific fields (e.g. `path`, `terminalId`) are in the same `params` object alongside `threadId`. ACP bridges SHOULD strip `threadId` before forwarding to the IDE when the IDE protocol does not define that field.

**Custom extensions**: Method pattern `ext/acp/<family>/<method>` where `<family>` was listed in `acpExtensions.extensions` (e.g. `ext/acp/_unity/scene_query`).

| ACP method (IDE) | Wire extension method |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `fs/readTextFile` | `ext/acp/fs/readTextFile` |
| `fs/writeTextFile` | `ext/acp/fs/writeTextFile` |
| `terminal/create` | `ext/acp/terminal/create` |
| `terminal/getOutput` | `ext/acp/terminal/getOutput` |
| `terminal/waitForExit` | `ext/acp/terminal/waitForExit` |
| `terminal/kill` | `ext/acp/terminal/kill` |
| `terminal/release` | `ext/acp/terminal/release` |

### 11.4 Desktop Node REPL Browser Runtime

The Desktop browser-use integration exposes agent tools through a **server → client** Node REPL backend. The server only sends these requests to a thread-bound client that declared both `capabilities.nodeRepl` and `capabilities.browserUse` during `initialize`.

#### `ext/nodeRepl/evaluate`

**Direction**: server → client (request, requires response)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID whose Desktop runtime owns the persistent REPL. |
| `evaluationId` | string | yes | Unique ID for this evaluation, used for cancellation and late-result suppression. |
| `code` | string | yes | JavaScript source to evaluate in the thread-bound persistent Node REPL. |
| `timeoutMs` | number | no | Requested overall timeout in milliseconds. Client may clamp to its supported range. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "text": "optional stdout-like text",
  "resultText": "serialized final expression result",
  "images": [
    { "mediaType": "image/png", "dataBase64": "..." }
  ],
  "logs": ["console output"],
  "error": "optional user-readable error"
}
```

The client should return before `timeoutMs` when possible. Browser sub-operations should use shorter internal timeouts and return a readable `error` rather than leaving the server request pending until the overall timeout.

#### `ext/nodeRepl/cancel`

**Direction**: server → client (request, requires response)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Thread ID whose REPL evaluation should be cancelled. |
| `evaluationId` | string | yes | Evaluation ID previously sent to `ext/nodeRepl/evaluate`. |

**Result**:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

If no matching in-flight evaluation exists, the client returns `{ "ok": false }`. Cancellation is best-effort: the client should abort pending browser operations, rebuild the thread's REPL context when needed, and ignore any late result from the cancelled evaluation.

---

## 12. Versioning and Compatibility

### 12.1 Protocol Version

The protocol version is a single integer string (`"1"`, `"2"`, etc.) returned in `initialize` as `serverInfo.protocolVersion`.

### 12.2 Compatibility Rules

- **Within a major version**: The server may add new optional fields to existing method params/results, add new notification methods, and add new error codes. Clients must ignore unknown fields and unknown notification methods.
- **Breaking changes** (removing fields, changing semantics, removing methods) require incrementing the protocol version.
- **Method additions**: New methods may be added within a major version. Clients that call an unknown method receive a `-32601` error and can fall back gracefully.

### 12.3 Negotiation

The client and server agree on the protocol version during `initialize`. If the server's `protocolVersion` is higher than what the client supports, the client should log a warning and proceed with best-effort compatibility (ignoring unknown fields and methods). If the server's version is lower, the client should restrict itself to the server's supported surface.

---

## 13. Full Turn Example

This section shows the complete message sequence for a turn where the agent reads a file, runs a test (requiring approval), and responds.

### 13.1 ACP client turn (extension proxy)

When the wire client is an **ACP bridge** (IDE ↔ AppServer), the agent may need to read files through the IDE. The server sends `ext/acp/*` to the bridge; the bridge forwards to the IDE and returns the result.

```
IDE (ACP)          ACP Bridge          AppServer
  |                    |                    |

  |                    | item/agentMessage/delta
  |                    |<-------------------|

  | session/prompt response (end_turn)      |

```

## 15. WebSocket Transport

### 15.1 Overview

The WebSocket transport is a network-accessible alternative to the stdio transport. It is the primary transport for external channel adapters (see the [External Channel Adapter Specification](external-channel-adapter.md)) and for any client that cannot be co-located with the server process.

Both transports use identical JSON-RPC 2.0 message shapes. The only differences are at the framing and connection-lifecycle layers described in this section.

| Property | stdio | WebSocket |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Connection model | 1:1 (one client per server process) | N:1 (multiple concurrent clients per server process) |
| Frame format | Newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) | One JSON-RPC message per WebSocket text frame (UTF-8) |
| Client lifecycle | Bounded to process lifetime | Independent per-connection |
| Authentication | Not applicable (process isolation) | Optional bearer token (see §15.4) |
| Health probes | Not applicable | HTTP `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` |

### 15.2 Endpoint

The server listens on a configurable host and port. The WebSocket upgrade endpoint is:

```
ws://HOST:PORT/ws
```

The same HTTP server also serves the health probe endpoints:

- `GET /healthz` — returns `200 OK` with body `{"status":"ok"}` when the server process is alive.
- `GET /readyz` — returns `200 OK` when the server has completed protocol startup and is ready to accept connections. Readiness does not wait for workspace or plugin MCP servers to finish connecting; MCP readiness and failures are reported through `mcp/status/list`.

The default listen address binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Binding to `0.0.0.0` or a public interface must be explicitly configured and requires authentication to be enabled (see §15.4).

### 15.3 Connection Lifecycle

Each WebSocket connection is fully independent:

1. Client opens a WebSocket connection to `ws://HOST:PORT/ws` (with optional `?token=` query parameter, see §15.4).
2. Server accepts the connection and creates a new `AppServerConnection` state object. At this point the connection is **unauthenticated and uninitialized**.
3. Client sends `initialize` as the first JSON-RPC message (same as stdio, see §3.1).
4. Server responds and the standard initialization handshake proceeds.
5. Normal protocol operation: client sends requests, server sends responses and notifications.
6. On connection close (either side), the server cancels all active thread subscriptions for that connection.

```
Client                                    Server
  |                                         |
  | WebSocket upgrade (GET /ws)             |
  |---------------------------------------->|
  |                                         |
  | 101 Switching Protocols                 |
  |<----------------------------------------|
  |                                         |
  | initialize (request, id: 0)             |
  |---------------------------------------->|
  |                                         |
  | (response, id: 0)                       |
  |<----------------------------------------|
  |                                         |
  | initialized (notification)              |
  |---------------------------------------->|
  |                                         |
  | (protocol ready)                        |
```

### 15.4 Authentication

When the server is configured with a bearer token, the token must be provided by the client in the WebSocket upgrade request URL:

```
ws://HOST:PORT/ws?token=<token>
```

The server validates the token before completing the WebSocket upgrade. If the token is missing or invalid, the server closes the connection with HTTP `401 Unauthorized` before the WebSocket handshake completes. The client never reaches the JSON-RPC `initialize` step.

Token validation rules:

- Tokens are compared using constant-time equality to resist timing attacks.
- An empty string is not a valid token. If the server is configured with an empty token, authentication is disabled.
- Token values must be URL-safe (alphanumeric plus `-`, `_`, `.`). Tokens that do not meet this requirement must be URL-percent-encoded by the client.

When the server is bound to `127.0.0.1` only, authentication is optional. When the server is bound to a non-loopback address, authentication must be enabled — the server refuses to start without a token in this configuration.

### 15.5 Multi-Connection Behavior

Multiple clients may be connected simultaneously. Each connection has isolated state:

- Its own `initialize`/`initialized` handshake.
- Its own set of active thread subscriptions (registered via `thread/subscribe`).
- Its own backpressure gate (32 concurrent in-flight requests, same as stdio).

Shared state across all connections on the same server process:

- The `ISessionService` instance (and therefore thread persistence) is shared. A thread started by one connection is visible to other connections that look it up via `thread/list` or `thread/read`.
- A `thread/subscribe` from Connection A will receive notifications for events triggered by Connection B on the same thread.

There is no built-in per-connection identity isolation. Callers with different privilege levels must use separate server processes or implement identity enforcement in the `SessionIdentity` layer.

### 15.6 Framing

Each JSON-RPC message is sent as a single WebSocket **text frame** (opcode `0x1`). The message must be a complete, valid JSON object. Binary frames are not used.

Servers and clients must not split a single JSON-RPC message across multiple frames, and must not combine multiple JSON-RPC messages into a single frame.

Maximum message size is 4 MB by default. Messages exceeding this limit cause the connection to be closed with WebSocket close code `1009` (message too big).

### 15.7 Reconnection

The WebSocket transport does not provide built-in session resumption. When a client reconnects after a disconnect:

- The client must perform the full `initialize` / `initialized` handshake again.
- Active thread subscriptions are lost and must be re-registered via `thread/subscribe`.
- Any turn that was in progress when the disconnect occurred continues executing on the server. The client can re-subscribe to the thread to receive subsequent notifications, but events emitted during the disconnection period are not replayed unless `replayRecent = true` is used in `thread/subscribe`.
- Server-to-client approval requests (`item/approval/request`) that were in flight when the client disconnected will time out according to the approval timeout policy (error code `-32020`), and the turn will fail.

Client reconnection behavior requirements:

- Clients should implement transport reconnection with **exponential backoff with jitter** starting at 1 second and capping at 30 seconds.
- After each successful transport reconnect, clients must run a fresh protocol handshake (`initialize`, then `initialized`) before issuing normal requests.
- Clients should track and re-register any prior thread subscriptions immediately after reconnect.
- If the client process starts before the server is reachable, the client should keep retrying transport connection using the same backoff policy and complete handshake as soon as the server becomes available.

### 15.8 Native WebSocket Ping/Pong

The server sends native WebSocket ping frames every 30 seconds to detect stale connections. If a client does not respond with a pong frame within 10 seconds, the server closes the connection. Clients that use compliant WebSocket libraries will handle pong responses automatically.

### 15.9 Differences from Stdio

| Behavior | stdio | WebSocket |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Connection count | One (process boundary) | Many (network connections) |
| Authentication | N/A | Optional token query param |
| Turn cancellation on disconnect | Turn is cancelled (process exit) | Turn continues; client must re-subscribe |
| Event replay on reconnect | N/A | Via `thread/subscribe replayRecent: true` |
| Approval request on disconnect | Turn cancelled (process exit) | Turn fails with `-32020` approval timeout |
| Diagnostic output | stderr | Not available on wire; use server logs |

## 16. Cron Management Methods

### 16.1 Scope

These methods extend the protocol beyond `ISessionService` to cover server-managed cron job lifecycle. They operate on shared server state that is independent of any session or thread.

Unlike thread/turn methods, cron methods are not scoped to a session, thread, or channel identity. They operate on the server's shared `CronService` singleton. All connections on the same server process observe the same cron state.

Clients must check `capabilities.cronManagement` in the `initialize` response before calling any `cron/*` method. If the flag is absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (method not found).

### 16.2 `CronJobInfo` Wire DTO

All cron methods that return job data use the following `CronJobInfo` wire object.

```json
{
  "id": "9c933b01",
  "name": "drink water reminder",
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "every",
    "everyMs": 3600000,
    "atMs": null,
    "initialDelayMs": null,
    "dailyHour": null,
    "dailyMinute": null,
    "tz": null
  },
  "enabled": true,
  "createdAtMs": 1710590400000,
  "deleteAfterRun": false,
  "state": {
    "nextRunAtMs": 1710594000000,
    "lastRunAtMs": 1710590400000,
    "lastStatus": "ok",
    "lastError": null,
    "lastThreadId": "thread_abc123",
    "lastResult": "提醒：该喝水了！保持水分对健康很重要。"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Short opaque job identifier (8 hex chars). |
| `name` | string | Human-readable job name. |
| `schedule.kind` | string | `"every"` (recurring), `"at"` (one-time), or `"daily"` (fixed local time of day). |
| `schedule.everyMs` | integer? | Interval in milliseconds. Present when `kind` is `"every"`. |
| `schedule.atMs` | integer? | Unix timestamp (ms) for one-time execution. Present when `kind` is `"at"`. |
| `schedule.initialDelayMs` | integer? | Present when `kind` is `"every"`: optional delay (ms) before the **first** run only; omitted or `null` when not used. |
| `schedule.dailyHour` | integer? | Present when `kind` is `"daily"`: local hour 0–23. |
| `schedule.dailyMinute` | integer? | Present when `kind` is `"daily"`: local minute 0–59. |
| `schedule.tz` | string? | IANA time zone id for `daily` schedules (e.g. `Asia/Shanghai`). Omitted or `null` means UTC. |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether the job is active and will fire when due. |
| `createdAtMs` | integer | Unix timestamp (ms) when the job was created. |
| `deleteAfterRun` | boolean | If `true`, the job is removed after its first successful execution. |
| `state.nextRunAtMs` | integer? | Unix timestamp (ms) of the next scheduled run. `null` if the job has no valid schedule. May still be set when `enabled` is `false` (paused; the slot is preserved). |
| `state.lastRunAtMs` | integer? | Unix timestamp (ms) of the last execution. `null` if never run. |
| `state.lastStatus` | string? | `"ok"` or `"error"`. `null` if never run. |
| `state.lastError` | string? | Error message from the last failed run. `null` when `lastStatus` is `"ok"` or never run. |
| `state.lastThreadId` | string? | Thread ID used for the most recent execution. `null` if the job has never run. |
| `state.lastResult` | string? | Agent's text response from the most recent execution, truncated to 500 characters. `null` if the job has never run or the last run produced no text output. |

### 16.3 `cron/list`

List cron jobs managed by the server.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `includeDisabled` | boolean | no | Default `false`. When `true`, disabled jobs are included in the result. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "9c933b01",
      "name": "drink water reminder",
      "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 3600000, "atMs": null },
      "enabled": true,
      "createdAtMs": 1710590400000,
      "deleteAfterRun": false,
      "state": {
        "nextRunAtMs": 1710594000000,
        "lastRunAtMs": 1710590400000,
        "lastStatus": "ok",
        "lastError": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Behavior**: Returns the server's current job list. When `includeDisabled` is `false` (default), only jobs with `enabled: true` are returned.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "cron/list", "id": 50, "params": {
    "includeDisabled": true
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 50, "result": {
    "jobs": [
      {
        "id": "9c933b01",
        "name": "drink water reminder",
        "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 3600000, "atMs": null },
        "enabled": true,
        "createdAtMs": 1710590400000,
        "deleteAfterRun": false,
        "state": { "nextRunAtMs": 1710594000000, "lastRunAtMs": null, "lastStatus": null, "lastError": null }
      }
    ]
} }
```

### 16.4 `cron/remove`

Permanently remove a cron job from the server.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `jobId` | string | yes | ID of the cron job to remove. |

**Result**:

```json
{ "removed": true }
```

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32031` | The specified `jobId` does not exist. |

**Behavior**: Removes the job from the server-managed cron set. If the job fires concurrently, removal is applied after the current execution completes.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "cron/remove", "id": 51, "params": {
    "jobId": "9c933b01"
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 51, "result": { "removed": true } }
```

### 16.5 `cron/enable`

Enable or disable a cron job.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `jobId` | string | yes | ID of the cron job to update. |
| `enabled` | boolean | yes | `true` to enable the job; `false` to disable it. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "job": { ... }
}
```

The `job` field contains the updated `CronJobInfo` object reflecting the new `enabled` state. When **enabling** a job, `state.nextRunAtMs` is recomputed **only** if it was `null` or less than or equal to the current time (UTC, i.e. due or overdue); otherwise the existing future `nextRunAtMs` is kept so pause/resume does not shift the schedule.

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32031` | The specified `jobId` does not exist. |

**Behavior**: Updates the job's `enabled` field in the server's in-memory `CronService`. Disabling does not clear `nextRunAtMs`. When enabling, `nextRunAtMs` is updated only as described above. Persists the change to disk immediately.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "cron/enable", "id": 52, "params": {
    "jobId": "9c933b01",
    "enabled": false
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 52, "result": {
    "job": {
      "id": "9c933b01",
      "name": "drink water reminder",
      "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 3600000, "atMs": null },
      "enabled": false,
      "createdAtMs": 1710590400000,
      "deleteAfterRun": false,
      "state": { "nextRunAtMs": 1710594000000, "lastRunAtMs": null, "lastStatus": null, "lastError": null }
    }
} }
```

### 16.6 `cron/run`

Manually queue one immediate run of a cron job.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `jobId` | string | yes | ID of the cron job to run now. |

**Result**:

```json
{ "queued": true, "job": { "...": "CronJobInfo" } }
```

**Behavior**: Queues one manual execution on the server's existing serialized cron execution queue and returns immediately. This does not change the job's `enabled` state; disabled jobs can still be run manually. The job state is updated when execution completes and is surfaced via `cron/stateChanged` / `system/jobResult` when those notifications are enabled.

### 16.7 Notification Opt-Out

Cron management methods (`cron/list`, `cron/remove`, `cron/enable`, `cron/run`) are request/response pairs. The `cron/stateChanged` notification (Section 16.8) is the real-time push for cron job state. The `system/jobResult` notification (Section 6.9) remains the full result delivery mechanism. Clients that do not need either can opt out:

| Method | When to opt out |
|--------|-----------------|
| `cron/stateChanged` | Client polls `cron/list` instead of reacting to push updates. |
| `system/jobResult` | Client does not need cron/heartbeat result notifications. |

### 16.8 `cron/stateChanged` Notification

**Direction**: server → client (notification)

Emitted when a cron job's state changes.

**Triggers**:

| Trigger | What changed |
|---------|-------------|
| Job execution completes (success or error) | `state.lastRunAtMs`, `state.lastStatus`, `state.lastError`, `state.lastThreadId`, `state.lastResult`, `state.nextRunAtMs` updated. |
| `cron/enable` called | `enabled` updated; `state.nextRunAtMs` may change when enabling only if the previous next run was missing or in the past (otherwise unchanged). |
| `cron/run` called | No immediate persisted field changes; completion later emits the normal execution update. |
| `cron/remove` called | Notifies clients the job no longer exists (see `removed` field). |

**Params**:

```json
{
  "job": {
    "id": "9c933b01",
    "name": "drink water reminder",
    "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 3600000 },
    "enabled": true,
    "createdAtMs": 1710590400000,
    "deleteAfterRun": false,
    "state": {
      "nextRunAtMs": 1710597600000,
      "lastRunAtMs": 1710594000000,
      "lastStatus": "ok",
      "lastError": null,
      "lastThreadId": "thread_abc123",
      "lastResult": "提醒：该喝水了！"
    }
  },
  "removed": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `job` | CronJobInfo | The updated job state. Contains the full `CronJobInfo` DTO reflecting the new state. |
| `removed` | boolean | `true` when the notification is triggered by `cron/remove`. When `true`, only `job.id` is guaranteed to be present. |

**Delivery**: Broadcast to all initialized connections that have not opted out of `cron/stateChanged`.

## 17. Heartbeat Management Methods

### 17.1 Scope

Like cron management (Section 16), these methods cover a server-managed background service. The `heartbeat/trigger` method lets clients trigger a heartbeat run on demand.

Clients must check `capabilities.heartbeatManagement` before calling any method in this section. If the capability is absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 17.2 `heartbeat/trigger`

Trigger an immediate heartbeat run on the server.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**: `{}` (empty object, no parameters required)

**Result**:

```json
{
  "result": "HEARTBEAT_OK",
  "error": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `result` | string? | Agent response text. `null` if no `HEARTBEAT.md` was found or its content was empty. |
| `error` | string? | Error message if the heartbeat run failed. `null` on success. |

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32601` | The heartbeat service is not configured on this server. |

**Timeout note**: This is a **long-running request**. Clients should use a generous timeout. The result is also separately broadcast via `system/jobResult` with `source: "heartbeat"` to subscribed clients.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "heartbeat/trigger", "id": 60, "params": {} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 60, "result": {
    "result": "Reviewed open issues and updated tracking.",
    "error": null
} }
```

### 17.3 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.heartbeatManagement` before calling `heartbeat/trigger`.

---

## 18. Skills Management Methods

### 18.1 Scope

These methods expose skill discovery and control to wire clients. Skills are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) that teach the agent specific capabilities. The server may load them from multiple sources with a defined priority order:

| Priority | Source | Location | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 (highest) | `builtin` | Server-defined | Server-provided built-in skill. |
| 2 | `workspace` | Server-defined | Workspace-scoped skill. |
| 3 (lowest) | `user` | Server-defined | User-scoped skill. |

When the same skill name exists in multiple sources, the higher-priority source takes precedence.

Skills may declare requirements (executables, environment variables) in their frontmatter. A skill whose requirements are not met is reported as `available: false` with a diagnostic reason.

Clients must check `capabilities.skillsManagement` in the `initialize` response before calling any `skills/*` method. If the flag is absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (method not found).

### 18.2 `SkillInfo` Wire DTO

All skills methods that return skill data use the following `SkillInfo` wire object.

```json
{
  "name": "browser",
  "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP - navigate, click, fill forms, take screenshots, and inspect web pages.",
  "displayName": "Browser Use",
  "shortDescription": "Automate browser-based workflows",
  "source": "builtin",
  "available": true,
  "unavailableReason": null,
  "enabled": true,
  "path": "/home/user/project/skills/browser/SKILL.md",
  "hasVariant": true,
  "iconSmallDataUrl": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,...",
  "iconLargeDataUrl": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "defaultPrompt": "Use $browser-use to inspect a local browser target.",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
    "bins": "npx"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Skill directory name, used as the skill identifier. |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description extracted from frontmatter `description` field. Falls back to `name` if absent. |
| `displayName` | string? | Optional UI display name from Codex-compatible `agents/openai.yaml` `interface.display_name`. |
| `shortDescription` | string? | Optional compact UI description from `agents/openai.yaml` `interface.short_description`. |
| `source` | string | One of `"workspace"`, `"plugin"`, `"builtin"`, or `"user"`. Indicates where the skill is installed. |
| `available` | boolean | `true` if all declared requirements (bins, env) are met on the server. |
| `unavailableReason` | string? | Diagnostic message listing missing requirements. `null` when `available` is `true`. |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` if the skill is active and will be included in agent context. `false` if the user has disabled it via `skills/setEnabled`. |
| `path` | string | Absolute filesystem path to the source `SKILL.md` file. |
| `hasVariant` | boolean? | Present and `true` when the current runtime resolves this skill through a current workspace variant. Omitted or `false` means the effective skill currently falls back to source. |
| `iconSmallDataUrl` | string? | Optional small icon as a data URL. Resolved only from safe relative paths inside the skill directory. |
| `iconLargeDataUrl` | string? | Optional large icon as a data URL. Resolved only from safe relative paths inside the skill directory. |
| `defaultPrompt` | string? | Optional default starter prompt from `agents/openai.yaml` `interface.default_prompt`. |
| `metadata` | object | Key-value pairs from the YAML frontmatter of `SKILL.md`. Common keys: `description`, `name`, `bins`, `env`, `always`. |

Servers may read Codex-compatible skill interface metadata from `agents/openai.yaml`:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Browser Use"
  short_description: "Automate browser-based workflows"
  icon_small: "./assets/browser-use-small.svg"
  icon_large: "./assets/browser-use.png"
  default_prompt: "Use $browser-use to inspect a local browser target."
```

Icon paths MUST be relative to the skill directory, MUST remain inside that directory after normalization, and SHOULD be ignored if missing, too large, or not an allowed image type.

### 18.3 `skills/list`

List all installed skills across all sources.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `includeUnavailable` | boolean | no | Default `true`. When `false`, skills with unmet requirements are excluded. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "browser",
      "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
      "source": "builtin",
      "available": true,
      "unavailableReason": null,
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/home/user/project/skills/browser/SKILL.md",
      "hasVariant": true,
      "metadata": { "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...", "bins": "npx" }
    },
    {
      "name": "create-hooks",
      "description": "Create and configure DotCraft lifecycle hooks...",
      "source": "builtin",
      "available": true,
      "unavailableReason": null,
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/home/user/project/skills/create-hooks/SKILL.md",
      "metadata": { "name": "create-hooks", "description": "Create and configure DotCraft lifecycle hooks..." }
    },
    {
      "name": "my-custom-skill",
      "description": "Custom workspace skill for this project.",
      "source": "workspace",
      "available": true,
      "unavailableReason": null,
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/home/user/project/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md",
      "metadata": { "description": "Custom workspace skill for this project." }
    },
    {
      "name": "code-review",
      "description": "Code review guidelines and procedures.",
      "source": "user",
      "available": true,
      "unavailableReason": null,
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "/home/user/.craft/skills/code-review/SKILL.md",
      "metadata": { "description": "Code review guidelines and procedures." }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Behavior**: Returns skills from all sources merged by the standard priority rules. Skills may have source `workspace`, `plugin`, `builtin`, or `user`. Plugin skills include `pluginId` and `pluginDisplayName` attribution. Workspace user-owned skills have highest priority, then enabled plugin skills, compatibility built-ins, and user-global skills.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "skills/list", "id": 70, "params": {} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 70, "result": {
    "skills": [
      {
        "name": "browser",
        "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
        "source": "builtin",
        "available": true,
        "unavailableReason": null,
        "enabled": true,
        "path": "/home/user/project/skills/browser/SKILL.md",
        "hasVariant": true,
        "metadata": { "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...", "bins": "npx" }
      }
    ]
} }
```

### 18.4 `skills/read`

Read the full content of a skill's `SKILL.md` file.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Skill name (directory name) to read. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "name": "browser",
  "content": "---\ndescription: \"Browser automation via Playwright MCP...\"\nbins: npx\n---\n\n# Browser Automation (Playwright MCP)\n\nYou have access to browser automation tools...",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
    "bins": "npx"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | The skill name that was requested. |
| `content` | string | Raw `SKILL.md` content including frontmatter. |
| `metadata` | object | Parsed frontmatter key-value pairs. `null` if the file has no frontmatter. |

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32040` | The specified skill name does not exist in any source. |

**Behavior**: Loads the resolved skill content according to the server's source-priority rules. Returns the raw markdown content of the `SKILL.md` file and its parsed frontmatter metadata.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "skills/read", "id": 71, "params": {
    "name": "browser"
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 71, "result": {
    "name": "browser",
    "content": "---\ndescription: \"Browser automation...\"\nbins: npx\n---\n\n# Browser Automation\n\n...",
    "metadata": { "description": "Browser automation...", "bins": "npx" }
} }
```

### 18.5 `skills/view`

Read the effective skill body after source/variant resolution.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Skill name to view. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "name": "browser",
  "content": "# Browser Automation\n\nYou have access to browser automation tools..."
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | The skill name that was requested. |
| `content` | string | Effective `SKILL.md` body with YAML frontmatter stripped. |

**Behavior**: Resolves the current workspace adaptation when one exists and falls back to the source skill otherwise. The result intentionally omits variant ids, source paths, fingerprints, and metadata.

### 18.6 `skills/restoreOriginal`

Restore the original source skill for the current workspace target.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Skill name to restore. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "name": "browser",
  "restored": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | The skill name that was requested. |
| `restored` | boolean | `true` when a current adaptation was restored; `false` when the skill was already using its source body. |

**Behavior**: Marks the current workspace adaptation as restored so future effective views fall back to the source skill. It does not modify the source skill.

### 18.7 `skills/setEnabled`

Enable or disable a skill. Disabled skills remain on disk but are excluded from agent context.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Skill name to enable or disable. |
| `enabled` | boolean | yes | `true` to enable the skill; `false` to disable it. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "skill": {
    "name": "browser",
    "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
    "source": "builtin",
    "available": true,
    "unavailableReason": null,
    "enabled": false,
    "path": "/home/user/project/skills/browser/SKILL.md",
    "metadata": { "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...", "bins": "npx" }
  }
}
```

The `skill` field contains the updated `SkillInfo` object reflecting the new `enabled` state.

On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "skills/setEnabled"` and `regions: ["skills"]`.

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32040` | The specified skill name does not exist in any source. |

**Behavior**: Toggles a skill's enabled state in the server's persisted skill-preference store.

When disabling, the skill is marked unavailable for future agent context resolution. When enabling, that exclusion is removed. If the skill is already in the requested state, the operation is a no-op and returns the current `SkillInfo`.

**Example**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "skills/setEnabled", "id": 72, "params": {
    "name": "browser",
    "enabled": false
} }

{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 72, "result": {
    "skill": {
      "name": "browser",
      "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...",
      "source": "builtin",
      "available": true,
      "unavailableReason": null,
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "/home/user/project/skills/browser/SKILL.md",
      "hasVariant": true,
      "metadata": { "description": "Browser automation via Playwright MCP...", "bins": "npx" }
    }
} }
```

### 18.8 `skills/uninstall`

Uninstall a user-managed source skill.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Skill name to uninstall. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "name": "code-review",
  "uninstalled": true,
  "source": "user",
  "removedSourcePath": "/home/user/.craft/skills/code-review",
  "removedVariantCount": 1
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | The skill name that was requested. |
| `uninstalled` | boolean | `true` when the source skill directory was removed. |
| `source` | string | Removed source kind, either `"workspace"` or `"user"`. |
| `removedSourcePath` | string | Absolute directory path that was removed. |
| `removedVariantCount` | number | Number of associated workspace variants removed. |

On success, the server removes the skill from `Skills.DisabledSkills`, deletes associated variants for that source skill, and emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "skills/uninstall"` and `regions: ["skills"]`.

**Errors**:

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `-32602` | The resolved skill source is `builtin` or `plugin`, or the source path is outside the expected skill root. |
| `-32040` | The specified skill name does not exist in any source. |

**Behavior**: Only `workspace` and `user` skills are directly uninstallable. `builtin` skills are managed by DotCraft, and `plugin` skills are managed by their owning plugin lifecycle.

### 18.9 Plugin Management Methods

Clients must check `capabilities.pluginManagement` before calling any `plugin/*` method. These methods expose local plugin discovery and workspace enablement state for Desktop and other UI clients. Plugin architecture, manifest fields, plugin-bundled MCP servers, and plugin-contained skills are defined in [Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md).

#### `plugin/list`

Returns discovered plugins, including disabled installed plugins and installable built-in catalog plugins when requested.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `includeDisabled` | boolean? | no | When false, disabled plugins are excluded. Default true. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "browser-use",
      "displayName": "Browser Use",
      "description": "Control the in-app browser with DotCraft",
      "enabled": true,
      "installed": true,
      "installable": false,
      "removable": true,
      "source": "workspace",
      "interface": {
        "displayName": "Browser Use",
        "shortDescription": "Control the in-app browser with DotCraft",
        "developerName": "DotHarness",
        "category": "Coding",
        "capabilities": ["Interactive", "Read", "Write"],
        "defaultPrompt": "Test my checkout flow on localhost"
      },
      "functions": [],
      "skills": [{ "name": "browser-use", "displayName": "Browser Use", "enabled": true }],
      "mcpServers": [
        {
          "name": "review",
          "runtimeName": "review-tools:review",
          "transport": "stdio",
          "enabled": true,
          "active": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "diagnostics": []
}
```

#### `plugin/view`

Returns one plugin by id.

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Plugin id. Legacy `node-repl` is accepted as an alias for `browser-use` only for compatibility. |

**Result**: `{ "plugin": PluginInfo }`

`PluginInfo` includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `installed` | boolean | True when the plugin exists in a discovered local plugin root and can contribute runtime behavior. |
| `installable` | boolean | True for known built-in catalog entries that are not installed in the workspace. |
| `removable` | boolean | True for DotCraft-managed built-in plugin directories that carry a `.builtin` marker. |
| `functions` | `PluginFunctionInfo[]` | Compatibility field for older clients; manifest native tools are no longer supported, so this is empty for plugin manifest contributions. |
| `skills` | `PluginSkillInfo[]` | Plugin-contained skills declared by the bundle. |
| `mcpServers` | `PluginMcpServerInfo[]` | Plugin-bundled MCP declarations. This is declaration metadata for the plugin detail page, not an editable workspace MCP config. |

`PluginMcpServerInfo` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Declared server name inside the plugin `.mcp.json`, for example `review`. |
| `runtimeName` | string | Effective runtime name, usually `{pluginId}:{name}`. |
| `transport` | `"stdio" \| "streamableHttp"` | MCP transport after normalization. |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether the bundled server declaration is enabled. |
| `active` | boolean | True when the plugin is installed, enabled, the server is enabled, and it is not shadowed by workspace or higher-priority plugin MCP. |
| `shadowedBy` | `"workspace" \| "plugin"` | Optional reason the bundled server is not active. |

#### `plugin/install`

Installs a known built-in plugin into the workspace.

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Canonical plugin id. |

**Result**: `{ "plugin": PluginInfo }`

On success, the server deploys the built-in resources to `.craft/plugins/<id>`, removes that id from `Plugins.DisabledPlugins`, refreshes plugin-contributed skill sources, reconciles effective MCP runtime state, and emits `workspace/configChanged` with `source: "plugin/install"` and `regions: ["plugins", "skills", "mcp"]`.

#### `plugin/remove`

Removes a DotCraft-managed built-in plugin from the workspace.

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Canonical plugin id. |

**Result**: `{ "plugin": PluginInfo }`

The server deletes only workspace plugin directories that carry the `.builtin` marker and are inside `.craft/plugins`. User-owned plugin directories are rejected. On success, the server refreshes plugin-contributed skill sources, reconciles effective MCP runtime state, and emits `workspace/configChanged` with `source: "plugin/remove"` and `regions: ["plugins", "skills", "mcp"]`.

#### `plugin/setEnabled`

Enables or disables an installed plugin for the workspace.

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Plugin id. |
| `enabled` | boolean | yes | Desired enabled state. |

**Result**: `{ "plugin": PluginInfo }`

`plugin/setEnabled` does not install a built-in catalog entry. If the plugin is not installed, the server rejects the request. On success, the server persists `Plugins.DisabledPlugins`, normalizes legacy `node-repl` entries to `browser-use`, refreshes plugin-contributed skill sources, reconciles effective MCP runtime state, and emits `workspace/configChanged` with `source: "plugin/setEnabled"` and `regions: ["plugins", "skills", "mcp"]`.

### 18.9 Error Codes

| Code | Constant | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `-32040` | `SkillNotFound` | The requested skill name does not exist in any source (workspace, user, or builtin). |

### 18.10 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.skillsManagement` before calling any `skills/*` method.
Clients should additionally check `capabilities.skillVariants` before offering variant-dependent UX such as restoring the original skill. `skills/view` may still be available as a source-only effective view when this capability is absent or false.
Clients must check `capabilities.pluginManagement` before calling any `plugin/*` method.

---

## 19. Command Management Methods

### 19.1 Scope

These methods expose the server-side command registry to wire clients.

- `command/list` returns discoverable server-registered command metadata (including custom commands, and optionally built-ins when requested).
- `command/execute` executes a slash command and returns a normalized `CommandResult`.

Command resolution and execution semantics are server-authoritative.
Client-local UX commands (for example CLI/TUI `/clear`) are intentionally outside this registry surface and do not need to appear in `command/list`.

### 19.2 `CommandInfo` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "/new",
  "aliases": [],
  "description": "Create a new conversation",
  "category": "builtin",
  "requiresAdmin": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Canonical slash command name. |
| `aliases` | string[] | Alternative slash names mapped to the same handler. |
| `description` | string | Localized or source description text shown to users. |
| `category` | string | `"builtin"` or `"custom"`. |
| `requiresAdmin` | boolean | Whether the command requires admin permission. |

### 19.3 `command/list`

List all available commands for the current workspace/runtime.

Clients that build a composer slash-command picker for `commandRef` insertion should pass `includeBuiltins = false` and treat the result as the custom-command catalog only. Built-in commands remain discoverable through `command/list` by default for general command surfaces.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `language` | string | no | Optional language override (`"zh"` or `"en"`). When omitted, server default language is used. |
| `includeBuiltins` | boolean | no | Optional filter for built-in commands. Defaults to `true`. Pass `false` when the caller wants a `commandRef`-safe custom-command list for a composer picker. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "/new",
      "aliases": [],
      "description": "Create a new conversation",
      "category": "builtin",
      "requiresAdmin": false
    },
    {
      "name": "/code-review",
      "aliases": [],
      "description": "Review changed files and report issues",
      "category": "custom",
      "requiresAdmin": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### 19.4 `command/execute`

Execute one slash command through the server-side command pipeline.

Built-in slash commands must be invoked through this method (or equivalent dedicated UI controls), not encoded as `commandRef` parts in `turn/start`.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `threadId` | string | yes | Target thread for command execution context. |
| `command` | string | yes | Slash command string, for example `"/stop"` or `"/cron"`. |
| `arguments` | string[] | no | Optional parsed arguments. Server also accepts empty/omitted and performs standard parsing from `command` when needed. |
| `sender` | SenderContext | no | Optional sender identity used for permission evaluation and auditing. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "handled": true,
  "message": "Started a new conversation.",
  "isMarkdown": false,
  "expandedPrompt": null,
  "sessionReset": true,
  "thread": {
    "id": "thread_20260414_ab12cd"
  },
  "archivedThreadIds": ["thread_20260414_old001"],
  "createdLazily": true
}
```

When `expandedPrompt` is non-null, the command resolved to a prompt expansion and the caller may submit that text with `turn/start`.

When `sessionReset` is `true` (for `/new`), clients should switch their active thread pointer to `thread.id` immediately. `createdLazily = true` means the new thread id is valid, but its thread file may not be materialized on disk until the first turn is submitted.

### 19.5 Error Codes

| Code | Constant | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `-32060` | `CommandNotFound` | The requested command is not registered. |
| `-32061` | `CommandPermissionDenied` | Caller lacks permission for an admin-only command. |
| `-32062` | `CommandServiceUnavailable` | Command exists but required backing service is unavailable. |

### 19.6 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.commandManagement` before calling `command/list` or `command/execute`.

## 19A. Background Terminal Methods

### 19A.1 Scope

These methods expose server-managed host shell processes that may continue after an `Exec` tool call returns. They are pipe-based in v1: clients can read output, write stdin, stop a session, list sessions, and clean all sessions for a thread. Full PTY/curses behavior and sandbox process persistence are outside this version.

Clients must check `capabilities.backgroundTerminals` before calling `terminal/*` methods. If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 19A.2 `BackgroundTerminal` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "sessionId": "term_abcd1234",
  "threadId": "thread_001",
  "turnId": "turn_001",
  "callId": "call_abc",
  "command": "npm run dev",
  "workingDirectory": "C:/repo",
  "source": "host",
  "status": "running",
  "output": "...",
  "outputPath": "C:/repo/.craft/terminals/thread_001/term_abcd1234.log",
  "exitCode": null,
  "startedAt": "2026-04-25T00:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": null,
  "wallTimeMs": 1000,
  "originalOutputChars": 42,
  "truncated": false,
  "backgroundReason": "runInBackground"
}
```

`status` is one of `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `killed`, `timedOut`, or `lost`.

### 19A.3 Requests

- `terminal/list` params: `{ "threadId"?: string | null }`, result: `{ "terminals": BackgroundTerminal[] }`
- `terminal/read` params: `{ "sessionId": string, "waitMs"?: number, "maxOutputChars"?: number }`, result: `{ "terminal": BackgroundTerminal }`
- `terminal/write` params: `{ "sessionId": string, "input": string, "yieldTimeMs"?: number, "maxOutputChars"?: number }`, result: `{ "terminal": BackgroundTerminal }`
- `terminal/stop` params: `{ "sessionId": string }`, result: `{ "terminal": BackgroundTerminal }`
- `terminal/clean` params: `{ "threadId": string }`, result: `{ "terminals": BackgroundTerminal[] }`

`terminal/read.waitMs` is the maximum time the server waits for an active terminal to produce an updated snapshot or exit. If the wait elapses before the process exits, the server may return the current `running` snapshot.

### 19A.4 Notifications

Servers that have a client-declared `backgroundTerminals` capability may emit:

- `terminal/started`
- `terminal/outputDelta`
- `terminal/completed`
- `terminal/stalled`
- `terminal/cleaned`

Notifications use the same terminal snapshot shape. `terminal/outputDelta` additionally carries the output delta text.

## 20. Channel Status Methods

### 20.1 Scope

These methods expose runtime status of social and external channels — whether each channel is configured and whether it is currently active.

The existing `channel/list` method returns discoverable origin names. It does not reflect configuration state or runtime activity. `channel/status` is a separate method that reports runtime status.

Clients must check `capabilities.channelStatus` in the `initialize` response before calling `channel/status`. If the capability is absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 20.2 `ChannelStatusInfo` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "qq",
  "category": "social",
  "enabled": true,
  "running": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Canonical channel name (matches `channel/list` names). |
| `category` | string | `social` or `external`. |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` when the channel is configured as enabled. |
| `running` | boolean | `true` when the server currently considers the channel active. |

Only channels that are explicitly configured for status reporting are included.

### 20.3 `channel/status`

Returns runtime status for all configured social and external channels.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**: `{}` (empty object) or omitted.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "qq",
      "category": "social",
      "enabled": true,
      "running": true
    },
    {
      "name": "wecom",
      "category": "social",
      "enabled": false,
      "running": false
    },
    {
      "name": "weixin",
      "category": "external",
      "enabled": true,
      "running": false
    },
    {
      "name": "telegram",
      "category": "external",
      "enabled": false,
      "running": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Semantics**:

- `enabled` reflects configuration state, not runtime activity.
- `running` reflects current server-observed activity state.
- Results are sorted by category order (`social` → `external`), then by `name` (ordinal case-insensitive).
- If the server has no channel status data, the result is an empty `channels` array.

### 20.4 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.channelStatus` before calling `channel/status`.

---

## 21. Model Catalog Methods

### 21.1 Scope

These methods expose provider model discovery so clients can populate model selectors without hardcoding model ids.

Clients must check `capabilities.modelCatalogManagement` in the `initialize` response before calling `model/list`. If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 21.2 `ModelCatalogItem` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "id": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "ownedBy": "openai",
  "createdAt": "2025-06-12T00:00:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Model id used in `config.Model` / request payloads. |
| `ownedBy` | string | Provider-reported owner string when available; may be empty. |
| `createdAt` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | Provider-reported creation time. |

### 21.3 `model/list`

Returns available models from the configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**: `{}` (empty object) or omitted.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "ownedBy": "openai",
      "createdAt": "2025-06-12T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

On provider/config errors, the method still returns a successful JSON-RPC response with structured error fields:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "models": [],
  "errorCode": "MissingApiKey",
  "errorMessage": "API key is not configured."
}
```

### 21.4 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.modelCatalogManagement` before calling `model/list`.

---

## 22. MCP Management Methods

### 22.1 Scope

These methods provide a server-authoritative read/write path for MCP server configuration.

Clients must check `capabilities.mcpManagement` before calling `mcp/list`, `mcp/get`, `mcp/upsert`, or `mcp/remove`. Clients must check `capabilities.mcpStatus` before calling `mcp/status/list` or relying on `mcp/status/updated` notifications.

### 22.2 `McpServerConfig` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "sqlite",
  "enabled": true,
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "openai-dev-mcp",
  "args": ["serve-sqlite"],
  "env": { "DB_PATH": "./test.db" },
  "envVars": ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
  "cwd": "./tools",
  "origin": { "kind": "workspace" },
  "readOnly": false
}
```

Supported fields:

- `name: string`
- `enabled: boolean`
- `transport: "stdio" | "streamableHttp"`
- `command?: string`
- `args?: string[]`
- `env?: Record<string, string>`
- `envVars?: string[]`
- `cwd?: string | null`
- `url?: string`
- `bearerTokenEnvVar?: string | null`
- `httpHeaders?: Record<string, string>`
- `envHttpHeaders?: Record<string, string>`
- `startupTimeoutSec?: number | null`
- `toolTimeoutSec?: number | null`
- `origin?: { kind: "workspace" | "plugin", pluginId?: string, pluginDisplayName?: string, declaredName?: string }`
- `readOnly?: boolean`

Validation rules:

- `name` is the logical primary key and is compared case-insensitively.
- `stdio` only allows `command`, `args`, `env`, `envVars`, and `cwd`.
- `streamableHttp` only allows `url`, `bearerTokenEnvVar`, `httpHeaders`, and `envHttpHeaders`.
- `mcp/test` validates and probes a temporary configuration but does not persist it.
- When `capabilities.mcpServerOrigins` is true, `mcp/list`, `mcp/get`, `mcp/status/list`, and `mcp/status/updated` include origin metadata. Workspace-origin servers are editable. Plugin-origin servers are read-only runtime entries derived from plugin `.mcp.json`.

### 22.3 `mcp/list`

Returns effective MCP runtime servers for the current workspace. The result includes workspace MCP servers and active plugin-bundled MCP servers. Workspace MCP takes precedence when a runtime name conflicts; shadowed plugin MCP remains visible on `plugin/list` / `plugin/view` as declaration metadata but is not returned by `mcp/list`.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "sqlite",
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "openai-dev-mcp",
      "args": ["serve-sqlite"],
      "origin": { "kind": "workspace" },
      "readOnly": false
    },
    {
      "name": "review-tools:review",
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "stdio",
      "origin": {
        "kind": "plugin",
        "pluginId": "review-tools",
        "pluginDisplayName": "Review Tools",
        "declaredName": "review"
      },
      "readOnly": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 22.4 `mcp/get`

Returns one configured MCP server by name.

**Params**:

```json
{ "name": "sqlite" }
```

### 22.5 `mcp/upsert`

Creates or replaces one workspace-origin MCP server definition. Clients MUST NOT send plugin-origin servers back to `mcp/upsert`.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "name": "docs",
    "enabled": true,
    "transport": "streamableHttp",
    "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
    "bearerTokenEnvVar": "DOCS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

**Semantics**:

- Upsert replaces the full logical server entry.
- Persistence shape and storage location are server-defined, but only workspace-origin servers are persisted to workspace config.
- If the target name currently resolves to a plugin-origin server, the server returns `McpServerReadOnly`.
- On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "mcp/upsert"` and `regions: ["mcp"]`.

### 22.6 `mcp/remove`

Removes one workspace-origin MCP server definition by name. Removing a plugin-origin server returns `McpServerReadOnly`; plugin-bundled MCP is controlled through plugin install/enable/remove lifecycle, not MCP settings persistence.

On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "mcp/remove"` and `regions: ["mcp"]`.

### 22.7 `McpServerStatus` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "sqlite",
  "enabled": true,
  "startupState": "ready",
  "toolCount": 3,
  "resourceCount": 0,
  "resourceTemplateCount": 0,
  "lastError": null,
  "transport": "stdio"
}
```

Runtime status is separate from config truth:

- `mcp/list` describes effective runtime configuration and may include plugin-origin read-only entries.
- `mcp/status/list` and `mcp/status/updated` describe runtime state. MCP startup runs in the background and must not block AppServer readiness or unrelated MCP management requests.

### 22.8 `mcp/status/list`

Returns current runtime state for all known MCP servers.

### 22.9 `mcp/test`

Validates and probes a temporary MCP configuration without persisting it.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "toolCount": 3
}
```

On failure, the method returns a successful JSON-RPC response with structured fields:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "McpServerTestFailed",
  "errorMessage": "Connection refused"
}
```

### 22.10 `mcp/status/updated`

Server notification emitted when one server's runtime status changes.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "mcp/status/updated",
  "params": {
    "server": {
      "name": "sqlite",
      "enabled": true,
      "startupState": "ready",
      "toolCount": 3,
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### 22.11 Error Codes

| Code | Constant | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `-32070` | `McpServerNotFound` | Requested MCP server name does not exist. |
| `-32072` | `McpServerValidationFailed` | MCP config payload is invalid for the selected transport. |
| `-32073` | `McpServerTestFailed` | Temporary test/probe failed. |
| `-32074` | `McpServerNameConflict` | Name conflicts with an existing logical key after case-insensitive comparison. |
| `-32075` | `McpServerReadOnly` | A write method attempted to modify a plugin-origin read-only MCP server. |

## 23. External Channel Management Methods

### 23.1 Scope

These methods provide a server-authoritative read/write path for external channel configuration.

Clients must check `capabilities.externalChannelManagement` before calling `externalChannel/list`, `externalChannel/get`, `externalChannel/upsert`, or `externalChannel/remove`. If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 23.2 `ExternalChannelConfig` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "telegram",
  "enabled": true,
  "transport": "subprocess",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-m", "dotcraft_telegram"],
  "workingDirectory": "./adapters/telegram",
  "env": { "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN": "..." }
}
```

Supported fields:

- `name: string`
- `enabled: boolean`
- `transport: "subprocess" | "websocket"`
- `command?: string`
- `args?: string[]`
- `workingDirectory?: string | null`
- `env?: Record<string, string>`

Validation rules:

- `name` is the logical primary key and is compared case-insensitively.
- `name` must not conflict with a reserved or existing channel name.
- `subprocess` requires `command`.
- `subprocess` allows `command`, `args`, `workingDirectory`, and `env`.
- `websocket` does not allow subprocess-only fields (`command`, `args`, `workingDirectory`, `env`).
- Persistence shape and storage location are server-defined.

### 23.3 `externalChannel/list`

Returns all configured external channels for the current workspace.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "telegram",
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "subprocess",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "dotcraft_telegram"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 23.4 `externalChannel/get`

Returns one configured external channel by name.

**Params**:

```json
{ "name": "telegram" }
```

### 23.5 `externalChannel/upsert`

Creates or replaces one external channel definition.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "channel": {
    "name": "weixin",
    "enabled": true,
    "transport": "websocket"
  }
}
```

**Semantics**:

- Upsert replaces the full logical channel entry.
- Persistence shape and storage location are server-defined.
- On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "externalChannel/upsert"` and `regions: ["externalChannel"]`.

### 23.6 `externalChannel/remove`

Removes one external channel definition by name.

On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "externalChannel/remove"` and `regions: ["externalChannel"]`.

### 23.7 Error Codes

| Code | Constant | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `-32080` | `ExternalChannelNotFound` | Requested external channel name does not exist. |
| `-32081` | `ExternalChannelValidationFailed` | External channel config payload is invalid for the selected transport. |
| `-32082` | `ExternalChannelNameConflict` | Name conflicts with an existing logical key or a native channel name after case-insensitive comparison. |

## 24. SubAgent Profile Management Methods

### 24.1 Scope

These methods provide a server-authoritative read/write path for workspace SubAgent profile configuration.

Clients must check `capabilities.subAgentManagement` before calling `subagent/profiles/list`, `subagent/settings/update`, `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`, `subagent/profiles/upsert`, or `subagent/profiles/remove`. If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 24.2 `SubAgentProfileWrite` Wire DTO

`definition` payloads use the full persisted SubAgent profile definition. The write payload mirrors the config shape of `SubAgentProfiles.<name>` and excludes `name`, which is carried by the RPC envelope.

Supported fields mirror the effective `SubAgentProfile` contract, including:

- `runtime`
- `bin`
- `args`
- `env`
- `envPassthrough`
- `workingDirectoryMode`
- `supportsStreaming`
- `supportsResume`
- `supportsModelSelection`
- `inputFormat`
- `outputFormat`
- `inputMode`
- `inputArgTemplate`
- `inputEnvKey`
- `resumeArgTemplate`
- `resumeSessionIdJsonPath`
- `resumeSessionIdRegex`
- `outputJsonPath`
- `outputInputTokensJsonPath`
- `outputOutputTokensJsonPath`
- `outputTotalTokensJsonPath`
- `outputFileArgTemplate`
- `readOutputFile`
- `deleteOutputFileAfterRead`
- `maxOutputBytes`
- `timeout`
- `trustLevel`
- `permissionModeMapping`
- `sanitizationRules`

### 24.3 `SubAgentProfileEntry` Wire DTO

```json
{
  "name": "codex-cli",
  "isBuiltIn": true,
  "isTemplate": false,
  "hasWorkspaceOverride": true,
  "isDefault": false,
  "enabled": true,
  "definition": {
    "runtime": "cli-oneshot",
    "bin": "codex",
    "workingDirectoryMode": "workspace"
  },
  "builtInDefaults": {
    "runtime": "cli-oneshot",
    "bin": "codex",
    "workingDirectoryMode": "workspace"
  },
  "diagnostic": {
    "enabled": true,
    "binaryResolved": true,
    "hiddenFromPrompt": false,
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

Supported fields:

- `name: string`
- `isBuiltIn: boolean`
- `isTemplate: boolean`
- `hasWorkspaceOverride: boolean`
- `isDefault: boolean`
- `enabled: boolean`
- `definition: SubAgentProfileWrite`
- `builtInDefaults?: SubAgentProfileWrite`
- `diagnostic: { enabled, binaryResolved, hiddenFromPrompt, hiddenReason?, warnings[] }`

Semantics:

- `definition` is the effective current definition after builtin + workspace override resolution.
- `builtInDefaults` is only present for builtin profiles.
- `hasWorkspaceOverride=true` means the workspace currently persists `SubAgentProfiles.<name>`.
- `diagnostic.hiddenFromPrompt` reflects effective prompt visibility after enablement, template handling, runtime registration, binary resolution, and validation are all applied.

### 24.4 `subagent/profiles/list`

Returns all builtin profiles plus workspace-defined custom profiles for the current workspace.

**Result**:

```json
{
  "defaultName": "native",
  "settings": {
    "externalCliSessionResumeEnabled": false,
    "model": null
  },
  "profiles": []
}
```

`settings.externalCliSessionResumeEnabled` is the workspace-scoped toggle that controls whether supported external CLI profiles may reuse saved external session ids.
`settings.model` is the optional workspace-scoped default model for DotCraft-managed SubAgents. `null` or an empty string means the server uses the effective MainAgent model for the current thread.
`SubAgent.MaxDepth` defaults to `1`, so root threads can spawn first-level SubAgents but child SubAgents cannot recursively call `SpawnAgent` unless the workspace explicitly raises the depth limit and the selected role exposes Agent control.

### 24.5 `subagent/settings/update`

Update workspace-level SubAgent settings.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "externalCliSessionResumeEnabled": true,
  "model": "gpt-4.1"
}
```

**Semantics**:

- clients may send `externalCliSessionResumeEnabled`, `model`, or both; at least one supported field is required
- `externalCliSessionResumeEnabled` updates `SubAgent.EnableExternalCliSessionResume`
- `model` updates `SubAgent.Model`; `null`, empty, or whitespace clears the SubAgent model override
- `SubAgent.Model` only affects DotCraft-managed native SubAgents in v1; external CLI profiles may opt into model selection in a future profile/runtime-specific contract
- the resume toggle affects only profiles whose effective definition has `supportsResume=true`
- clearing or changing these settings does not delete existing saved external session ids
- on success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 25.5](#255-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "subagent/settings/update"` and `regions: ["subagent"]`

### 24.6 `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`

Enable or disable one profile for the current workspace.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "name": "cursor-cli",
  "enabled": false
}
```

**Semantics**:

- updates `SubAgent.DisabledProfiles`
- returns the updated `SubAgentProfileEntry`
- `native` is protected and cannot be disabled
- on success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 25.5](#255-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "subagent/profiles/setEnabled"` and `regions: ["subagent"]`

### 24.7 `subagent/profiles/upsert`

Create or replace one workspace profile definition.

**Params**:

```json
{
  "name": "my-local-agent",
  "definition": {
    "runtime": "cli-oneshot",
    "bin": "my-agent",
    "workingDirectoryMode": "workspace",
    "inputMode": "arg",
    "outputFormat": "text"
  }
}
```

**Semantics**:

- builtin name creates or replaces a workspace override
- non-builtin name creates or replaces a custom workspace profile
- the workspace persists the full expanded definition
- on success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 25.5](#255-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "subagent/profiles/upsert"` and `regions: ["subagent"]`

### 24.8 `subagent/profiles/remove`

Remove one workspace-managed SubAgent definition.

**Params**:

```json
{ "name": "codex-cli" }
```

**Semantics**:

- builtin name removes only the workspace override and restores builtin defaults
- custom name removes the workspace profile entirely
- removing a builtin profile that has no workspace override fails
- on success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 25.5](#255-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "subagent/profiles/remove"` and `regions: ["subagent"]`

**Result**:

```json
{ "removed": true }
```

### 24.9 Error Codes

| Code | Constant | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `-32083` | `SubAgentProfileNotFound` | Requested profile or workspace override does not exist. |
| `-32084` | `SubAgentProfileValidationFailed` | The profile payload is invalid or incompatible with runtime rules. |
| `-32085` | `SubAgentProfileProtected` | The requested operation targets a protected profile such as `native`. |

### 24.10 Session-Backed SubAgent Child Threads

Servers advertising `capabilities.subAgentSessions = true` expose profile-backed SubAgents as ordinary child threads plus a lightweight parent/child graph. Native profiles run real child agent turns; external CLI profiles persist synthetic child turns containing the submitted prompt, final output or error, and token metadata when available.

`agentRole` selects the child thread role. Built-in roles are `default`, `worker`, and `explorer`; workspace configuration may override or add roles. The resolved role determines the child thread's tool allow/deny policy, Agent control exposure, prompt profile, and role instructions. External CLI profiles receive role instructions as prompt context, but the server cannot enforce tool filtering inside a third-party CLI runtime.

`thread/list` hides subagent child threads unless `includeSubAgents` is true. Children follow the parent lifecycle: parent archive/unarchive/delete recursively applies to descendants, and direct child archive/delete calls are invalid. Clients rendering a composer-adjacent background-agent widget should use `subagent/children/list` for the active parent thread, then call `thread/read` for a child when the user expands or jumps into it.

When `includeThreads` is true, the returned child thread uses the same wire model as `thread/read` and may include a `runtime` snapshot derived from persisted turns. Clients should use `thread.runtime.running` to decide whether the child is actively executing. `edge.status: "open"` means the parent/child relationship remains available for resume/control and must not by itself be interpreted as a running child.

#### `subagent/children/list`

Params:

```json
{
  "parentThreadId": "thread_parent",
  "includeClosed": false,
  "includeThreads": true
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "edge": {
        "parentThreadId": "thread_parent",
        "childThreadId": "thread_child",
        "parentTurnId": "turn_1",
        "depth": 1,
        "agentNickname": "Worker",
        "agentRole": "worker",
        "profileName": "native",
        "runtimeType": "native",
        "supportsSendInput": true,
        "supportsResume": true,
        "supportsClose": true,
        "status": "open"
      },
      "thread": {
        "id": "thread_child",
        "source": {
          "kind": "subagent"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `subagent/close` and `subagent/resume`

Both methods accept:

```json
{
  "parentThreadId": "thread_parent",
  "childThreadId": "thread_child"
}
```

`subagent/close` cancels any active child turn when the server still owns the running task, then marks the parent/child edge closed. `subagent/resume` resumes the child thread and marks the edge open; it does not automatically send input to the child.

## 25. Workspace Config Methods

### 25.1 Scope

These methods provide a server-authoritative write path for workspace-level configuration values.

In v1, the wire surface standardizes workspace model persistence while keeping per-thread overrides in `thread/config/update`.

Clients must check `capabilities.workspaceConfigManagement` in `initialize` before calling workspace configuration methods (`workspace/config/schema`, `workspace/config/update`). If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 25.2 `workspace/config/schema`

Return the server-derived workspace config schema, including per-field reload metadata.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**: `{}`

**Result**:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "section": "Core",
      "order": 0,
      "path": null,
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "ApiKey",
          "type": "password",
          "sensitive": true,
          "reload": "processRestart"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Semantics**:

- The payload is additive and forward-compatible; clients must ignore unknown properties.
- `reload` uses the `ReloadBehavior` enum names serialized as camelCase strings.
- `subsystemKey` is present only when `reload` is `subsystemRestart`.

### 25.3 `workspace/config/update`

Update workspace-level config values.

**Direction**: client → server (request)

**Params**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `model` | string \| null | no | Workspace default model. `null`, empty, or `"Default"` removes the `Model` key so runtime falls back to provider default behavior. |
| `apiKey` | string \| null | no | Workspace API key. `null` or empty removes the `ApiKey` key. |
| `endPoint` | string \| null | no | Workspace API endpoint. `null` or empty removes the `EndPoint` key. |
| `welcomeSuggestionsEnabled` | boolean \| null | no | Workspace-level override for personalized welcome suggestions. `true` enables, `false` disables, and `null` removes the explicit override so server defaults apply. |
| `skillsSelfLearningEnabled` | boolean \| null | no | Workspace-level override for `Skills.SelfLearning.Enabled`. `true` enables the SkillManage tool surface and skill-authoring built-in skill, `false` disables, and `null` removes the explicit override so server defaults apply (`true` by default). Takes effect on next AppServer restart (`Skills.SelfLearning.Enabled` is a `ProcessRestart` field). |
| `memoryAutoConsolidateEnabled` | boolean \| null | no | Workspace-level override for `Memory.AutoConsolidateEnabled`. `true` enables turn-count-based long-term memory consolidation, `false` disables it, and `null` removes the explicit override so server defaults apply (`true` by default). Takes effect for future successful turns without restart. |
| `defaultApprovalPolicy` | string \| null | no | Workspace default approval policy for threads whose `ThreadConfiguration.approvalPolicy` is `default` or unset. Supported values are `default` and `autoApprove`; `null` removes the explicit workspace override so server defaults apply. |

**Result**:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "apiKey": "sk-live-key",
  "endPoint": "https://example.com/v1",
  "welcomeSuggestionsEnabled": true,
  "skillsSelfLearningEnabled": true,
  "memoryAutoConsolidateEnabled": true,
  "defaultApprovalPolicy": "default"
}
```

If `model` is removed, the result returns:

```json
{
  "model": null
}
```

**Semantics**:

- This method updates **workspace default** only, not any active thread state.
- Clients that need immediate effect in a running thread should additionally call `thread/config/update`.
- Server preserves unrelated configuration state.
- At least one of `model`, `apiKey`, `endPoint`, `welcomeSuggestionsEnabled`, `skillsSelfLearningEnabled`, `memoryAutoConsolidateEnabled`, or `defaultApprovalPolicy` must be provided.
- Key matching is case-insensitive and normalized in-place (`Model`, `ApiKey`, `EndPoint`).
- When `skillsSelfLearningEnabled` is provided, the server writes the boolean to the nested `Skills.SelfLearning.Enabled` key. Setting it to `null` removes the leaf, and the server prunes empty `Skills.SelfLearning` / `Skills` objects when no other keys remain.
- When `memoryAutoConsolidateEnabled` is provided, the server writes the boolean to `Memory.AutoConsolidateEnabled`. Setting it to `null` removes the leaf, and the server prunes the empty `Memory` object when no other keys remain.
- When `defaultApprovalPolicy` is provided, the server writes the value to `Permissions.DefaultApprovalPolicy`. Setting it to `null` removes the leaf, and the server prunes the empty `Permissions` object when no other keys remain.
- On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` (see [Section 24.5](#245-workspaceconfigchanged)) with `source: "workspace/config/update"` and one or more regions from `workspace.model`, `workspace.apiKey`, `workspace.endpoint`, `welcomeSuggestions`, `skills`, `memory`, `workspace.defaultApprovalPolicy`.

### 25.4 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.workspaceConfigManagement` before calling workspace configuration methods (`workspace/config/schema`, `workspace/config/update`).

Clients may set `capabilities.configChange = false` during `initialize` to suppress server-initiated `workspace/configChanged` notifications for that connection. When omitted, the server treats it as `true`.

### 25.5 `workspace/configChanged`

Server notification emitted after a successful workspace configuration write.

**Direction**: server → client (notification, no `id`)

**Params**:

```json
{
  "source": "skills/setEnabled",
  "regions": ["skills"],
  "changedAt": "2026-04-19T10:15:03Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | string | RPC method that triggered the mutation (`workspace/config/update`, `memory/reset`, `skills/setEnabled`, `skills/uninstall`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/remove`, `plugin/setEnabled`, `mcp/upsert`, `mcp/remove`, `externalChannel/upsert`, `externalChannel/remove`, `subagent/settings/update`, `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`, `subagent/profiles/upsert`, `subagent/profiles/remove`). |
| `regions` | string[] | Coarse region tags describing what changed. |
| `changedAt` | string (ISO-8601) | Server-side UTC timestamp when the change event was emitted. |

Current `regions` taxonomy:

| Region | Fired by |
|--------|----------|
| `workspace.model` | `workspace/config/update` |
| `workspace.apiKey` | `workspace/config/update` |
| `workspace.endpoint` | `workspace/config/update` |
| `welcomeSuggestions` | `workspace/config/update` |
| `skills` | `skills/setEnabled`, `skills/uninstall`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/remove`, `plugin/setEnabled`, `workspace/config/update` |
| `plugins` | `plugin/install`, `plugin/remove`, `plugin/setEnabled` |
| `memory` | `workspace/config/update`, `memory/reset` |
| `workspace.defaultApprovalPolicy` | `workspace/config/update` |
| `mcp` | `mcp/upsert`, `mcp/remove`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/remove`, `plugin/setEnabled` |
| `externalChannel` | `externalChannel/upsert`, `externalChannel/remove` |
| `subagent` | `subagent/settings/update`, `subagent/profiles/setEnabled`, `subagent/profiles/upsert`, `subagent/profiles/remove` |

Semantics:

- Notification is emitted after write completion and in-process state update.
- Payload is intentionally coarse; clients should re-read relevant state (`skills/list`, `mcp/list`, etc.) when needed.
- Unknown region tags are forward-compatible and must be ignored by clients that do not recognize them.

### 25.6 Backward Compatibility

- Clients that set `capabilities.configChange = false` are supported indefinitely and simply do not receive `workspace/configChanged` on that connection.
- Older servers may not emit `workspace/configChanged`; clients must tolerate its absence and rely on existing refresh paths.

## 26. Memory Management Methods

These methods provide a server-authoritative path for destructive workspace memory maintenance.

Clients must check `capabilities.memoryManagement` in `initialize` before calling memory management methods. If absent or `false`, the server returns `-32601` (Method not found).

### 26.1 `memory/reset`

Clear the current workspace's durable memory artifacts.

**Direction**: client -> server (request)

**Params**: omitted, `null`, or `{}`

**Result**:

```json
{}
```

**Semantics**:

- The server clears the contents of the current workspace memory root, including `MEMORY.md`, `HISTORY.md`, and derived memory files, while preserving the memory directory itself.
- The operation does not delete sessions, archived sessions, thread history, skills, plugins, automation tasks, or configuration.
- The operation preserves `Memory.AutoConsolidateEnabled`; future successful turns may create new memory according to the current configuration.
- The server clears memory-derived welcome suggestion caches so clients do not continue displaying suggestions generated from deleted memory.
- On success, the server emits `workspace/configChanged` with `source: "memory/reset"` and `regions: ["memory"]`.

### 26.2 Capability Advertisement

Clients must check `capabilities.memoryManagement` before calling `memory/reset`.

## 27. Design Inspiration

The DotCraft AppServer Protocol's architecture references the Codex App Server
design. The overall structural approach - a JSON-RPC 2.0 surface layered around
Thread / Turn / Item primitives, streaming event notifications, and a
bidirectional approval flow - was adopted as the starting point for this
specification.

From that starting point, the protocol has been adapted to DotCraft's domain
model and implementation goals. The specific methods, notifications, item
types, capability flags, transport behaviors, and extension surfaces in this
document are defined on their own terms in the preceding sections and should
be treated as the authoritative contract.
